# Example questions

Questions will be asked along the course's learning goals (e.g., "learn how to scrape") and six cognitive skill levels (e.g., "application") (for details, see [here](../exam#content)). Below, you can find a few example questions. Example questions will be discussed with students in the final live stream of this course.

## Part 1

{{< hint warning >}}

This part of the exam consists of __personalized open and closed (multiple-choice) questions__, shown in __random order__.

{{< /hint >}}

![](../exam-part-1.png)

*Note: the number of questions depends on the points awarded to each question. The instructions during the final exam may slightly vary, so make sure to still read it accordingly.*

1. According to "Fields of Gold", what are useful dimensions to distinguish websites when considering them for a scraping project? (*knowledge*)

2. What is the purpose of `beautifulSoup` in the context of web scraping? (*comprehension*)

3. Please describe the difference between the "two scraping philosophies" when it comes to retrieving and storing data by means of web scraping (according to "Fields of Gold"). (*comprehension*)

4. What conclusions can you draw with regard to the accuracy of the timestamps provided in the user review section of metacritic (e.g., https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-godfather/user-reviews )? Provide a short answer in less than 50 words. (*analysis*)

## Part 2:

{{< hint warning >}}

This part of the exam consists of __personalized open questions__, shown in __random order__. You can freely go back and forth between these questions.

### Question 1 (small coding task)

Please take a look at the code snippet below, which retrieves data from an API. After running the code, you notice you get a series of non-200 responses. Modify the code so that it runs smoothly and reliably retrieves data for 100 requests.

```
# example code here

```

### Question 2 (small essay to form a judgment)

Please evaluate the feasibility of this data extraction plan:

### Question 3 (large coding task)

#### Web scraping

Please collect the product names and prices for all books listed in this section: https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/nonfiction_13/index.html. Please not only list these variables, but also provide timestamps from the moment that you started your data collection.

Submit your (a) Python code (as `.py` or `.ipynb`), along with the collected data (`.csv`).

#### APIs

As a researcher you're interested in polarity in online communities and therefore collect data on the distribution of up and down votes on Reddit. Extract a random sample of at least 100 Reddit posts from the [`politics`](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics) and [`science`](https://www.reddit.com/r/science) communities. Store the original JSON response, along with a parsed CSV dataset with the ID and text of a post.

Submit your (a) Python code (as `.py` or `.ipynb`), along with the collected data (`.json` and `.csv`).

## 1. Python Bootcamp

*Question type: Application*

Write a function `url_detector()` that loads a list of URLs from the file [`urls.txt`](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-odcm/blob/master/content/docs/course/exam/urls.txt), and filters that list for valid URLs, starting with `https` and containing a link to a product ID. Although you could rely on [regular expressions](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/develop-your-coding-skills/learn-to-code/learn-regular-expressions/) to get the job done, other simpler workarounds exist. How many URLs do you end up with?


## 2. Web Scraping  

*Question type: Synthesis*

Scrape the top 1000 lifetime grossing movies (domestic) from [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW). Filter down on movies released since 2000 and export the rank, title, and lifetime gross of these movies to a CSV file.


## 3. APIs

*Question type: Application*

As a researcher you're interested in polarity in online communities and therefore collect data on the distribution of up and down votes on Reddit. Extract a random sample of at least 100 Reddit posts from the [`politics`](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics) and [`science`](https://www.reddit.com/r/science) communities and compare the upvote ratio. Comment on your findings.

## 4. Workflow

*Question type: Evaluation*

Review the following text in which a master student describes the institutional background of the data collection. The thesis centers around the effect of hiding like counts on user behavior and thus proposes a methodology for sample construction. Describe how you would define the treatment and control group, and how you would go about collecting data on a user-level. Keep in mind ethical and legal concerns of collecting and storing data.

*Late April 2019 Instagram announced that it would run an experiment among Canadian users in which the like counts were hidden (Constine 2019). Three months later, around mid-July, they expanded the treatment to users in various other countries including Australia, Canada, and Italy. Users located in these countries could not see the number of likes on media posted by others, whereas users living anywhere else could still view like counts (Loren 2020). Thus, treatment groups enter the treated pool of persons sequentially, and assignment to the treatment or control condition was dependent on usersâ€™ geography.*
