# Web scraping Advanced

## Learning goals

- Learn how to make HTTP requests in  browser, with and without headers (and the implications thereof)
- Save content of a headless HTTP request to a file, and explore content (and compare content to one that you see in a browser)
- Learn about the structure of websites and "anchors" to identify elements (e.g., CSS selectors, XPATH)
- Extract elements using CSS selectors, XPATH, and extract values (e.g., text, attributes) from it
- Load seeds, wrap scraping code in a function, and call that function over the seeds (looping)
- Basics in error handling (try, except)
- Basics in scraping tech (e.g., `time.sleep(1)`)
- Compare headless scraping to remote-controlled browser and discuss benefits/drawbacks
