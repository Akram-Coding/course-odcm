  - Goals of using web scraping and APIs for...
    - academic research (example papers)
    - business (example businesses, "investing into data")

  - Activity: [split by academic research/ topic, vs. business): generating ideas for potential data sources / phenomena ("what's hot right now? What are important phenomena?", "what excites you about a potential area? what would be cool websites to monitor today?"

  - Discuss: in which area does it fall? are people monitoring that site already? what capture would you hope to achieve? is this more "investment in data?"/"timeliness", or more robustness? is this more a covariate or a key thing?
