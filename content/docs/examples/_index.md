# Examples and extra material

This site collects links to web scrapers and API retrieval projects.

## Web scrapers
- Great websites to start your first scraping project
  - [Boxofficemojo](https://boxofficemojo.com) is well structured and has stats on movie revenue, release date, and actors
  - [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com) has stats on players in US sports (baseball, basketball, football, hockey)
  - [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.com) is also locally available, but keep your maximum retrieval frequency at 1 page per second.
- [Netflix Home Screen Capture](https://github.com/hannesdatta/data-netflix)
- [Playlist Promotions and New Releases at Spotify](https://github.com/hannesdatta/data-spotify-playlists-releases)

## APIs
- [Documenting data collected via APIs (Chartmetric)](https://github.com/hannesdatta/data-spotify-playlist-ecosystem)

## Tools
- [Code to monitor the health of online data collections via Push Messages](https://github.com/hannesdatta/healthmonitor)

## Podcasts and Tutorials
- [Listen to a podcast with Kimberly Fessel](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/12/) who shares some best practices on scraping the web. She also has shared a [fantastic tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUQWPJ1T6Zc&t=190s)


Other advantages: clicking on things and filling out fields
Scrapy - cloud deployment and built a "spider" (scraper that keeps on going and look for new links)
Importance of visualising your results dynamically/interactively (D3, Plotly, Tableau)
Data widgets getting more mainstream (e.g., NYT) - people getting more data literate
