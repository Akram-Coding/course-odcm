## Learning objectives

- Familiarze yourself with data structures common in empirical marketing research
- Use R to read in, clean, and engineer data sets for empirical analysis
- Get to know, store and manage structured and unstructured data in file-based systems and databases
- Operationalize variables from numerical, textual, and visual raw data
<!--  - Advanced file I/O: Data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON), systems (e.g., file-based, structured and unstructured databases), and local vs. remote architectures
  - Common data manipulation techniques in R using `data.table` and `tidyverse`
    - Aggregation
    - Conversion between long and wide formats
    - Merging data sets
    - Looping (e.g., over variables, over data splits)
    - Writing functions in R
    - Variable operationalization in big data sets
-->
- Use workflow management techniques to create automated and reproducible data pipelines
<!--  - Data pipelines
  - Automation using `make`
  - Command-line scripting
-->
- Gain practical experience in versioning code and managing projects on GitHub
<!--  - Project management on GitHub (versioning, issue management, collaboration)-->
- Assess data quality by means of log files and diagnostic tables/figures
<!-- by producing log files and diagnostic tables and figures
<!--      - Logging into audit txt files
      - Generation of Latex and Word output
      - Report preparation in latex/Overleaf
-->

<!--  - Externally (EC2, launching instances, manage HPC code)
Work on VMs on AWS, code in SQL and R, compete on Kaggle, or work on own computer--; Coding Dojo student-=led analysis; while sharing screens-->
<!--
  - Logging/monitoring
    - Dynamic output:
      - Shiny
      - NodeJS/dynamic graphs
-->
- Gain practical experience using R (`data.table`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2`), work on virtual machines on AWS EC2, and write basic code in SQL
<!--, MySQL, MongoDB and Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 and S3-->
- Document and archive final data sets, and learn how to make them available for public (re)use
<!--- Track and share your own progress on the course's learning goals
- Critically evaluate your contribution and the contribution of team members to group projects ("peer assessment")
-->
## Grading

- Group project (4-5 team members) with peer assessment (40%) (can do 60%?)
<!-- submitted as a GitHub repository (during the course); building a dataset-->
- Computer exam (60%) [or, take-home exam?] (can do 40%?) with a passing threshold?
<!--
- Share progress and learnings (e.g., open science contributions in the form of course-relevant contributions in the form of pull requests to GitHub, maintaining a public FAQ/blog, sharing one's progress with the group) (20%) [[[???]]]
-->

Students pass this course if the final course grade (i.e., the weighted average of the components above) is at least 5.5/10.



## Format

- Taught fully online on Zoom, with the option for lab sessions on campus
- Hybrid format: Interactive notebooks or pre-recorded web clips for preparation and self-paced lab sessions; live streams for feedback and joint coding sessions (recordings will be made available)
- Modern content: copy-paste code snippets and demos from the course page, access code on GitHub, start projects with workflow templates
- Interactive, immersive and student-centred: live coding, hackathon, debates, working with real data sets

<!--, simulations, hackathon-->
<!-- work on VMs on AWS, code in SQL and R, compete on Kaggle, or work on own computer--; Coding Dojo student-=led analysis; while sharing screens-->

## Student profile / prerequisites

- The course is intended for both novices and those students with a technical background.
  - We recommend novices to familiarize themselves with R before the start of the course. Material (e.g., courses at datacamp.com) will be shared with students in advance.
  - Alternatively, novices may benefit from following other courses at Tilburg University in which R is used.
- The course is instructed to MSc students in the Marketing Analytics (TiSEM) program.
- A high level of commitment, both in terms of time and effort, is expected.

## Enrollment and Obtaining Course Credits

- The course (3 ECTS) will be taught in the Marketing Analytics Program at Tilburg University (please check Osiris for the specifics).
- Research Master or PhD students interested in best practices for building complex data sets for empirical analysis can audit this course upon the approval of [the instructor](mailto:h.datta@tilburguniversity.edu).
