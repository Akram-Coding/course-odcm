# Activity #2: Data source selection

## Overview
- Type: Meetup with your team during the coaching session 
- Goal: building on [activity #1](activity1) and the received feedback, refine your data context and make a final selection for your data source 


## Preparation before the activity

- Work through the "Fields of Gold" paper (at least up to challenge #1.3). Make use of the  relevant tables in the paper as you work on this activity.

## Deliverable

During the coaching session, work on a document that you submit on Canvas as a PDF file, containing your team number and three sections:
    
- Section 1: Updated motivation of your data context (why do you think it's important?!), and explanation which four pathways are being addressed [100 words]
- Section 2: An updated list of data sources (including links) that you are considering to use, explicitly mention web scraping vs. APIs for each source. Explain how you addressed challenges #1.1-#1.2, leading to your __selected data source__ [About 10 sources + explanation of max. 250 words]
- Section 3: Mapping the data context, as explained in challenge #1.3 [max. 300 words]

The document is due at the end of the week.

__Solicit feedback on your ideas from your coach during the coaching session.__

Done early? Then start prototyping your data collection (i.e., prepare for activity #3).

## Overview
- Type: Team presentation
- Duration: 3 minutes per team + 2 minutes discussion (please pick one person to present/lead the discussion)

## Getting started
- Before meeting up as a team (e.g., on Zoom - you can schedule unlimited calls when logging in with your Tilburg University account), please individually take [a personality test](https://www.123test.com/team-roles-test/) - will you be the team's *driver*, or rather perform important tasks as an *analyst*?
- During your first meeting, spend a good amount of time getting to know each other, *welcoming* new members to the group (e.g., those that signed up later), and telling about the result of your personality test (and whether you agree or disagree!)

## Presentation
- As per the methodological framework for collecting web data (see ["Fields of Gold"](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F00222429221100750)), please create a 3-slide presentation per team.
    - Slide 1: Motivation for data context & explanation on its importance
    - Slide 2: Data source selection
        - Which data sources were explored? (challenge #1.1)
        - Which data extraction method is employed (e.g., web scraping, vs. APIs), and why? (challenge #1.2)
    - Slide 3: Exploration of the data context (challenge #1.3)

**Tips**

- Slides will not be used for *presenting*, so they can be relatively text-heavy ("McKinsey slides", rather than presentable "five bullets max")
- Indicate your team number on the slides!
- Already take a look at "Challenges and Solutions in Source Selection" (Table 2) in the paper - it will help you judge whether the chosen data source is appropriate!)

## Submission
  - Please upload the slide deck both as a PDF and as a Powerpoint (in one zip file) on Canvas at the latest by 8am on the day of the live stream.
