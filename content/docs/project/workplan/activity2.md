# Activity #2: Data Source Exploration

## Overview
- Type: Team presentation
- Duration: 3 minutes per team + 2 minutes discussion (please pick one person to present/lead the discussion)

## Getting started
- Before meeting up as a team (e.g., on Zoom - you can schedule unlimited calls when logging in with your Tilburg University account), please individually take [a personality test](https://www.123test.com/team-roles-test/) - will you be the team's *driver*, or rather perform important tasks as an *analyst*?
- During your first meeting, spend a good amount of time getting to know each other, *welcoming* new members to the group (e.g., those that signed up later), and telling about the result of your personality test (and whether you agree or disagree!)

## Presentation
- As per the methodological framework for collecting web data (see ["Fields of Gold"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3820666)), please create a 3-slide presentation per team.
    - Slide 1: Motivation for data context & explanation on its importance
    - Slide 2: Data source selection
        - Which data sources were explored? (challenge #1.1)
        - Which data extraction method is employed (e.g., web scraping, vs. APIs), and why? (challenge #1.2)
    - Slide 3: Exploration of the data context (challenge #1.3)

**Tips**

- Slides will not be used for *presenting*, so they can be relatively text-heavy ("McKinsey slides", rather than presentable "five bullets max")
- Indicate your team number on the slides!
- Already take a look at "Challenges and Solutions in Source Selection" (Table 2) in the paper - it will help you judge whether the chosen data source is appropriate!)
