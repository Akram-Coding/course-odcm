# Coaching sessions

## Overview

- During the course, you will have the opportunity to meet up with the course instructor for coaching sessions.
- These sessions are meant for you to receive feedback on your code. Frequently, this also entails problem-solving & debugging.

## Preparing for a coaching session

- Check whether a solution to your problem has been posted already.
  - Check this site
  - Check [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdDbyJQwReWhis9Ns7_NfYzw4YAp91D6G), or the associated [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/hannesdatta)
  - Do your own Google/StackOverflow search

- Download & install [TeamViewer](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/teamviewer)

## Joining a coaching session

- Start your scripts (e.g., in Jupyter Notebook), so that the problem is "on the screen" (i.e., so that your coach can fiddle around with it)

- Join the scheduled Zoom session, and share in a private message to the course instructor your TeamViewer ID & temporary password.

- Be prepared that the course instructor takes over your screen. Be able to talk (i.e., check your microphone settings before!).
