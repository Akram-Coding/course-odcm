# Activity #4: Prototype Development

## Overview
- Type: Code (preferred) or screencast
- You *can* submit - for live feedback - one or more of the following works. Note that it is not *mandatory* to upload material. Instead, the submissions should be seen as a way to receive feedback on your projects.

## Activities

- Start __building a prototype script__ (Jupyter Notebook, or `.py` file) that demonstrates the first steps in writing your data extraction/scraping code. You can also use your script to illustrate some of the technical hurdles you are facing. Please test whether the script/Notebook runs correctly (e.g., open it on another computer, and run it top to down). Make use of comments in your code to point users to problems.
    - When submitting, please label your file as `scraper_teamXX.ipynb` or `scraper_teamXX.py`.

- If you're team has not managed to write code yet, you can record a __short screencast__ (max. 2 minutes), in which you *illustrate how your extraction software* will have to navigate on the website/through the API ("navigation path"). Your raw recording can be longer than 2 minutes, BUT, you are required to trim it to 2 minutes in the final submission. In other words - we recommend you cut "silent moments" (e.g., when a website is being loaded). Please have a voice-over, in which you explain how your scraper will have to navigate on the site, including when to loop, and how to use pagination.
  - When submitting, please label your file as `navigation_teamXX.mp4` (or any other video format).


## Submission
- Please upload on Canvas (in one zip file), at the latest by 8am on the day *preceding* the live stream.
- Code and screencasts will be used in the live stream. Make sure others can understand your work (e.g., by using comments, being sufficiently elaborate)!
- Indicate your team number in the file names.
