# Tutorial: Web data for dummies

## Learning goals

* Explain the differences between retrieving data from websites vs. APIs
* Retrieve web data in Python using the `requests` library, and store retrieved data in HTML or JSON/TXT files for further inspection.
* Use browser control tools ("inspect") to develop strategies how to select and capture information from websites (e.g., text, numbers, pictures, etc.)
* Select elements from websites using BeautifulSoup (e.g., class names, attribute or tag names)
* Select elements from JSON dictionaries obtained through APIs (attribute-value pairs)
* Apply programming concepts (e.g., loops, functions) to the collection of web data, and convert dictionaries to JSON files.

## Prerequisites

* Basic Python skills, for example by working through the [Python Bootcamp](../pythonbootcamp/).
