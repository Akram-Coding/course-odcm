## Getting started

If you haven't done so, please install the [required software](../software).

The tutorial proceeds in three steps.

1. __Optional__ - If you are completely new to Python, we recommend following this Python introduction course on Datacamp. (about 3-4 hours)
    - Complete the [Datacamp course "Introduction to Python"](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) [Only modules 1, 2 & 3].
2. Get familiar with Jupyter Notebook (about 30 minutes)
    - [Watch this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk)
3. Work through this notebook with additional material (about 2-3 hours)
    - Either [download the tutorial](python-bootcamp.zip) (right-click, download linked file as...). Then, open the file in Jupyter Notebook and start the tutorial!
    - Alternatively, open the workbook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hannesdatta/course-odcm/blob/master/content/docs/tutorials/pythonbootcamp/python-bootcamp.ipynb). <!-- the zip file also includes the data they need for the last few exercises -->
