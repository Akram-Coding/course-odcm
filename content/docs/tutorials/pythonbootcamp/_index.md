# Tutorial: Python Bootcamp for Collecting Web Data 

## Learning goals

* Locally launch Jupyter Notebook and Spyder
* Know when it's useful to use Google Colab in the cloud
* Understand basic programming concepts and their applications to collecting web data

## Getting started

The tutorial proceeds in two steps.

1. In-class tutorial ([download](python-bootcamp-in-class.ipynb), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hannesdatta/course-odcm/blob/master/content/docs/tutorials/pythonbootcamp/python-bootcamp-in-class.ipynb))
2. After-class exercises (about 2-3 hours; [download](python-bootcamp.zip), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hannesdatta/course-odcm/blob/master/content/docs/tutorials/pythonbootcamp/python-bootcamp.ipynb))
<!-- the zip file also includes the data they need for the last few exercises -->

__Downloading to and starting the tutorial on your computer__

- Right-click on the download link and select "download linked file as...)".
- Move the file to a convenient file location (e.g., somewhere in your course folder)
- If the downloaded file is a `.zip` (compressed) file, unzip it.
- Open Jupyter Notebook (e.g., using the terminal or the Anaconda Navigator), navigate to the folder where you stored the downloaded files, and open the `.ipynb` file from within Jupyter Notebook.
- Start with the tutorial!

  - Regular expressions (`import re`)
  - Dictionaries (for JSON objects)
  - Arrays for looping through a list of text
  - Functions
  - Error handling (`try` and `except`)
- Reading from and writing to ASCII files (e.g., .txt, .csv)
- Know where to look for help (e.g., Stackoverflow)
- Understand benefits and drawbacks from a local setup (compared to a cloud-based setup)
- Get to know Jupyter Notebook and Spyder
  - Learn various ways to launch Jupyter Notebook and Spyder (command prompt, Navigator), and find your working directory & files
  - Learn about the differences between Jupyter Notebook and Spyder, and when to use what
  - Jupyter Notebook specifics: Learn about markdown cells vs. code cells, and how to execute those
  - Spyder specifics: Code execution
  - Open files downloaded from the internet (e.g., `.ipynb`, `.py`)

## Getting started

If you haven't done so, please install the [required software](../software).

The tutorial proceeds in three steps.


1. Get familiar with Jupyter Notebook (about 30 minutes)
    - [Re-watch this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk)
3. Work through this notebook with additional material (about 2-3 hours)
    - Either [download the tutorial](python-bootcamp.zip) (right-click, download linked file as...). Then, open the file in Jupyter Notebook and start the tutorial!
    - Alternatively, open the workbook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hannesdatta/course-odcm/blob/master/content/docs/tutorials/pythonbootcamp/python-bootcamp.ipynb). <!-- the zip file also includes the data they need for the last few exercises -->

### Step 2) Get to know Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is a handy tool popular for teaching Python. Wonder why? [Read about it here](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/), and continue to watch the tutorial video below.

**Tips**

- You do not need to understand all the code that is shown in the notebook (0:47; 18:02; 22:48).
- If you followed step 1 above, you should have already installed Jupyter Notebook (2:47).
