# Tutorial: Python Bootcamp for Collecting Web Data 

## Learning goals

* Locally launch Jupyter Notebook and Spyder
* Know when it's useful to use Google Colab in the cloud
* Understand basic programming concepts and their applications to collecting web data

## Getting started

The tutorial proceeds in two steps.

1. In-class tutorial ([download](python-bootcamp-in-class.ipynb), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hannesdatta/course-odcm/blob/master/content/docs/tutorials/pythonbootcamp/python-bootcamp-in-class.ipynb))
2. After-class exercises on Datacamp.com (about 3 hours; [work on the first three chapters only](https://datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science))

<!--

If you're new to Python, please work through the first 3 chapters of the Introduction to Python Datacamp course.

You need to have an understanding of variables, lists, and functions. In class, you already practiced with loading a Jupyter Notebook and perform basic operations in Python.
