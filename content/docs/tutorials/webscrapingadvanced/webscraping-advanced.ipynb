    "### 1.1 Why Selenium? \n",
    "In the Web Scraping 101 tutorial, we used BeautifulSoup to turn HTML into a data structure that we could search and access using Python-like syntax. While it's easy to get started with this library, it has limitations when it comes to dynamic websites. That is, websites of which the content changes after each page refresh. Selenium can handle both static and dynamic websites and mimic user behavior (e.g., scrolling, clicking, logging in). It launches another web browser window in which all actions are visible which makes it feel more intuitive. For example, the video below launches a regular Google Chrome window and visits [`instagram.com`](https://www.instagram.com). This browser window behaves like normal, so you can click on buttons and fill out fields. Yet you can distinguish it from your normal web browser by the header that indicates that Chrome is being controlled by automated test software. Before you can try it out yourself, we need to install some additional software which we'll explain next. \n",

    "### 1.2 Installing Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Selenium with Jupyter Notebook on your own computer\n",
    "You will need to (1) install the Python package for Selenium, (2) download a web driver to interface with a web browser, and (3) configure Selenium to recognize your web driver.\n",
    "1. Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac), type the command `conda install selenium`, and agree to whatever the package manager wants to install or update (usually by pressing `y` to confirm your choice). \n",
    "2. Once we run the scraper, a Chrome browser launches which requires a web driver executable file. Download this file from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) (open [this](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-version-of-chrome-do-i-have) site in Chrome to identify your current Chrome version). \n",
    "3. Unzip the file and move it to the same directory where you're running this notebook. Either you can set a `chrome_path` manually (e.g., `/Users/royklaassebos/Google Drive/2020/Data_Scientist_Tilburg/oDCM/chromedriver` in my case) or ideally you make Chromedriver available through a so-called PATH variable so that you can access it regardless of your current directory. To do so, ...\n",
    "    * Windows users can follow the steps described [here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/configure/python-for-scraping). If that doesn't work for you, [this](https://zwbetz.com/download-chromedriver-binary-and-add-to-your-path-for-automated-functional-testing/) guide may help.\n",
    "    * Mac users need to move the `chromedriver` file to the `/usr/local/bin` folder. `cd` to the directory of the `chromedriver` file and type `mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin`.\n"

In particular, social network services rely on scrolling and clicking interactions to achieve this. As said many times before, this is just the beginning of your scraping journey. For example, see whether you can exploit Instagram's explore function to filter down on posts with a specific [tag](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/tilburguniversity/)\n",
