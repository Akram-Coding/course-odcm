In this case we pick the [book catalogue](https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books_1/index.html) as our seed.

    "For that reason, we need to be more specific so that we only scrape the links to the book pages and ignore all other `<a>` tags. Let's briefly revisit the notion of HTML classes. A class is often used as a reference in the code. For example, to make all text elements with a given class blue or increase the font size. In the Google Inspector screenshot above you find an `<article>` tag with class `product_pod` in which a `<div>` is nested which contains the image and link attribute we're after. Every link to a book is nested within this class, but aforementioned `<a>` tags in the header and sidebar are not. Thus, if we can tell our scraper that we're only interested in the `<a>` tags within the `product_pod` class, we end up with our desired selection of links."

This returns a list with all 20 `product_pod` classes on the page (i.e., one for each book). In this example, we pick the first book from the list (A Light in the Attic, element `[0]` from the list) and extract the `<a>` tag nested within the `product_pod` class. Finally, we pull out the `href` attribute from the `<a>` tag which gives us the book link."

Note the two-step structure of the for-loops: on every page we create a `books` object which we subsequently loop over by extracting the `book_title` and `book_url` from each book. These records are added to the dictionary `book_dict` which is eventually returned by the function."

    "### 3.1 Jupyter Notebooks vs Spyder\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for combining programming and markdown (e.g., text, plots, equations) which makes it the default choice for sharing and presenting data analyses from a reproducibilty standpoint. Since we can execute code blocks one by one it's suitable for developing and debugging code on the fly. There are, however, some limitations to Jupyter Notebooks which makes us consider other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Spider. First, the order in which you run cells within a notebook may affect the results. While prototyping you may lose sight of the top down hierarchy which can cause problems once you restart the kernel (e.g., a library is imported after is being used). Second, there is no easy way to browse through directories and files within a Jupyter Notebook. Third, notebooks cannot handle large codebases nor big data particularly well. For those reasons, we recommend starting out in Jupyter Notebooks, moving code into functions along the way, and once all seems to be running well, copy paste all necessary code into Spider. From there you can save it as a Python file (`.py`) - rather than a notebook (`.ipynb`) - and execute the file from the command line. Next, we introduce you to the Spider IDE, and learn you how to run Python files from the command line. \n",
