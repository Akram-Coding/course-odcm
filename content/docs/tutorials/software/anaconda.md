Anaconda is a collection of software for data scientists. It's super easy to install, and provides students with a uniform experience of Python.

**Tips**

- The installation of Anaconda can **easily take half an hour**! So make sure to have it installed before the start of the class!
- We recommend installing the Anaconda Individual Edition (Anaconda 64-Bit Graphical Installer; version 3.8), which you find [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Make sure to select the correct package for your operating system.
- In the video (at 2:23), we open the Command Prompt. On Mac, this program is called Terminal (for more information see [this](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl/#/) interactive walkthrough - optional).
