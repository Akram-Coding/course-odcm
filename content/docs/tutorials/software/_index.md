# Software installation

## Learning goals

- Set up your computer for conducting web scraping in Python
  - Install Anaconda/Python 3
  - Install Chrome
  - Install chromedriver and configure environment variables
- Understand the need for a local setup (vis-a-vis a cloud-based setup, which we strongly disadvise for this class)
- Get introduced to Jupyter Notebook and Spyder
  - Learn various ways to launch Jupyter Notebook and Spyder (command prompt, Navigator), and implications for the current working directory
  - Learn about the differences between Jupyter Notebook and Spyder, and when to use what
  - Jupyter Notebook specifics: Learn about markdown cells vs. code cells, and how to execute those
  - Spyder specifics: Code execution
  - Open files downloaded from the internet (e.g., `.ipynb`, `.py`)
- Enable you to have the software setup right to follow basic tutorials in Python,


## Getting started
- Access to a computer with administrator rights (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- We strongly advise not to use Chromebooks (Android)


## Anaconda Install

[![Anaconda Install Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/hGZSAuDcmQc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGZSAuDcmQc)

- We recommend installing the Anaconda 64-Bit Graphical Installer (version 3.8) you find at the bottom of [this](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) page.
- At 2:23 Hannes opens the Command Prompt. On Mac this program is called the Terminal (for more information see [this](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl/#/) interactive walkthrough - optional).


## Jupyter Notebooks

- This video walks you through the user interface of Jupyter Notebooks. You do not need to understand all the code shown in the notebook (0:47; 18:02; 22:48).
- If you followed the Anaconda Install tutorial above, you should have already installed Jupyter Notebook (2:47).
