# Software installation

## Motivation
Obtaining data via web scraping and APIs isn't usually something you do "in your browser". Certainly for continuous data collections, a *local* setup is required. That's why you need to install software on your computer before you can get started. All the software used in this class is available open source, i.e., you don't need to pay for it.

## Learning goals
- Install Anaconda/Python 3
  <!--
  - Set up your computer for conducting web scraping in Python
  - Install Chrome
  - Install chromedriver and configure environment variables -->
- Understand the need for a local setup (compared to a cloud-based setup, which we do not recommend for this class)
- Get introduced to Jupyter Notebook and Spyder
  - Learn various ways to launch Jupyter Notebook and Spyder (command prompt, Navigator), and find your working directory & files
  - Learn about the differences between Jupyter Notebook and Spyder, and when to use what
  - Jupyter Notebook specifics: Learn about markdown cells vs. code cells, and how to execute those
  - Spyder specifics: Code execution
  - Open files downloaded from the internet (e.g., `.ipynb`, `.py`)
- Be able to follow basic tutorials in Python

## Getting started
1. You need access to a computer with administrator rights (Windows, Mac, or Linux - we don't recommend Chromebooks)
2. [Install Anaconda](anaconda.md) (this may take about half an hour)
3. [Familiarize yourself with Jupyter Notebook](jupyter.md)
