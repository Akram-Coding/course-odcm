# Software installation

## Motivation
Obtaining data via web scraping and APIs isn't usually something you do "in your browser". Certainly for continuous data collections, a *local* setup is required. That's why you need to install software on your computer before you can get started. All the software used in this class is available open source, i.e., you don't need to pay for it.

## Learning goals
- Install Python 3 via Anaconda
- Be able to follow basic Python tutorials (e.g., on Datacamp)

## Getting started

### Step 1) Install Python via Anaconda

Please follow the installation guide for [Python via Anaconda](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/python).

**Tips**
- The installation of Anaconda can **easily take half an hour**! Please install it before the start of the class, and ensure you have administrator rights.
- We recommend installing the Anaconda Individual Edition (Anaconda 64-Bit Graphical Installer; version 3.9), which you find [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Make sure to select the __correct package for your operating system.__
- In the tutorial (at 2:23), we open the Command Prompt. On Mac, this program is called Terminal (for more information see [this](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl/#/) interactive walkthrough - optional).

### Step 2) Getting to know Python

If you are completely new to Python, we already recommend following this Python introduction course on Datacamp (about 3-4 hours). This will give you a head-start for this class!
