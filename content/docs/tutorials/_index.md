  - Practice
    - Swapping CSS selectors
    - Parsing multiple endpoints

2. Web scraping 101
  - Do
    - Applications: spotifcharts.com (headless), socialblade.com (simulated browser)
    - Building and iterating through seeds (predefined, on the basis of an external list, on the basis of a web-scraped list)
    - Avoiding simple errors (`time.sleep`)
  - Practice
    - Extend to other site that downloads stuff (which site?)
    - Extend to long list of seeds (self-obtain)

3. APIs 101
  - Do
    - Applications: Twitter API (with authentication)
    - Ideally not with a pre-made package
    - Ideally data from different endpoints
    - JSON file structures
  - Practice
    - Extend to other end points?
    - Extensive parsing exercises

4. Web Scraping Advanced

<!--

## Principles/points of discussion

- Ideally, notebooks themselves present *usuable* marketing cases already
- Tutorials
  - ...
- cases and examples [Case ideas for marketers; extend, put student examples here?]
  - scrape prices
  - collect buienradar data
  - collect social media
  - collect reviews data
  - collect twitter data
  - deploy dashboard
  - automate emails
  - collect from Twitter
  - ...other examples?
  - "big picture" cases
- The tutorials should pick up some of the concepts from the workflow
- Challenge is to build both concepts and skills, and to learn about the basic concepts of scraping
