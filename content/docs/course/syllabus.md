## Course description

### Learning goals

The internet offers abundant possibilities to collect data (e.g., from social networks, digital media providers, price comparison websites, online platforms) that can be used in empirical research projects and/or provide business value. After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Explain how web data has been used in the academic marketing literature
-	Select web data sources and evaluate their value in the context of a specific research question or business problem
- Design the web data collection while balancing validity, technical feasibility and exposure to legal/ethical risks
- Collect data via web scraping and Application Protocol Interfaces (APIs) by mixing, extending, and repurposing code snippets
- Document and archive collected data and make it available for public (re)use
- Track, evaluate and share your progress on the course's learning goals[^1]

[^1]: Students use a web app to monitor their progress on the course's learning goals by "ticking off" items from a to-do list (e.g., "I have installed Python," "I have finished Tutorial X," etc.). The instructor can use the app to learn which topics to highlight during live streams. Students, in turn, can use the app to see how far others in the class have already proceeded, giving them direct feedback on their performance.

### Positioning of the course in the study program

The course is instructed to MSc students in the Marketing Analytics (TiSEM) program. Seats are also offered to interested Research Master and PhD students. Learn more about enrollment [here](enroll).

Considering the typical process in which research is carried out, this course is positioned *at the beginning of a research project* (i.e., when the research question is being defined and the data being collected). This course does not zoom in on *how to analyze* data collected from the web but focuses on the process of collecting data for later use (e.g., for thesis or PhD projects). Therefore, students are recommended to follow this course before embarking on thesis projects.

To illustrate the wide range of applications of web data, the course introduces both national and international websites and APIs. For example, the Dutch price comparison website inprijsverhoogd.nl monitors prices across a wide range of retailers on a global scale. When collecting web data for their research, students mostly rely on a mix of both Dutch and international data sources, ranging from Dutch e-retailers (e.g., Coolblue, Bol, Albert Heijn) and marketplaces (e.g., Autoscout) to globally available platforms (e.g., Reddit, Twitch, Kayak).
 
## Prerequisites

- The course uses Python for the technical implementation of collecting web data. The course welcomes novices, of whom a significant investment of effort and time is required to learn the necessary skills.
- [Preparation material](../modules/prep) is available in the form of Jupyter Notebooks or course recommendations at Datacamp. Novices may further benefit from following other courses at Tilburg University in which Python is used, for example, *Research Skills: Data Processing* and *Research Skills: Data Processing Advanced*.
- Students are recommended to use their computer for this course (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Android/Chromebook/iOS devices are not supported. Cloud services (e.g., Tilburg's Jupyter server) is not fully supported because they usually do not allow you to see what happens "outside" of Jupyter Notebook.


## Teaching format

- Online-only (on Zoom; first and last lecture may take place on Campus)
- Combination of self-paced tutorials (e.g., using Jupyter Notebooks or pre-recorded clips), and interactive live streams for feedback and coaching (recordings are shared with students)
- Learn state-of-the-art tools popular among scientists, marketing analysts, and data scientists (e.g., Python), and collect data from real websites and APIs
- Open education & open science (all material is open; publicly accessible course page that stays with you, even after the end of the course)

<!--, simulations, hackathon-->

## Assessment

- [Team project](project) (45%, out of which 10% are based on students' individual contribution, measured by [self- and peer assessment](peerassessment))
- [Computer exam](exam) (50%)
- Submitting one's progress on the course's learning goals  (5%)[^2]

[^2]: In particular, students regularly monitor their progress on the course's learning goals. At least one evaluation per course week is required to obtain points on this component of the course grade.

### Passing requirements

Students pass this course if
- the final course grade (i.e., the weighted average of the following three components: (1) the group project, (2) the exam, and (3) the pass or fail on submitting one's progress on the course's learning goals); weights indicated above) is ≥ 5.5, and
- the exam grade is higher than or equal to 5.0 (≥ 5.0).

Final course grades are rounded to multiples of half points (e.g., 6, 6.5, 7, etc.).

### Resit policy

- If students have a grade lower than 5.0 on the exam, they cannot pass this course.
  - Required action: Students will have to take the [exam resit](exam).
- If students are not part of a team, they cannot obtain a grade for the team project and hence cannot pass this course.
  - Required action: Re-enroll in this course's next edition, and ensure you are part of a team.
- If students have an exam grade higher or equal to 5.0 but fail the team project (after SPA correction), their total course grade may be lower than 5.5, and hence students fail this course.
  - Required action: Correct team project based on the course coordinator's grading report, and hand it in again within two weeks after publication of the final grades in this course (submission on Canvas). Only students who fail the team project can have their projects re-graded.
- Students who have passed the course, but wish to retake the exam, can take the exam resit. The highest exam grade counts. Grades for the team project are retained. In other words, the resit exam still counts for 55% of the final course grade.
- Students who fail the exam and wish to re-take the course in the subsequent semester can *retain* their assignment grades upon approval of the course coordinator (grades remain valid for the *next* edition of the course)

## Code of Conduct

- When meeting on Zoom, please turn on your camera, which will facilitate interaction with the course instructor and other students.
- Please always use English as the default language so that non-Dutch speakers can follow the conversations, even if it concerns topics not directly related to the class (e.g., during breaks).
- Please head over the course's [support section](support) to solve problems or get in touch with the instructor.
- Stay up-to-date by checking this website, Canvas, and watch out for [updates/polls on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannes-datta/) and videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/hannesdatta).
- Be on time, and start on time
- Feel invited always to provide informal feedback!
- It's totally fine calling the instructor by his first name. Also, add your instructor

__We value diversity and inclusion__

We do our best to embrace diversity and stimulate integration in this course. We encourage students to be proud of their background (e.g., ethnicity, nationality), personal interest (e.g., hobbies), or any other thing that characterizes them. Two ways for students to bring in *their perspective* is choosing (a) with whom to collaborate (e.g., purposefully bring in people of diverse backgrounds or technical skill levels to a team), and (b) which topic to work on in the team project (e.g., spending sufficient time getting to know each other, creating a safe space, and being open to work on topics off the mainstream).

Please feel invited to talk to the course coordinator at any point in time!
