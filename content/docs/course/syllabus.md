# Syllabus

## Learning objectives

The internet offers abundant possibilities to collect data (e.g., from social networks, from digital media providers, from price comparison websites, from online platforms) that can be used in empirical research projects and/or provide business value. After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

-	Identify online data sources and evaluate their value in the context of a specific research question or business problem
- Assess the terms and conditions for collecting, storing, and sharing data
- Collect data via web scraping and Application Protocol Interfaces (APIs) by mixing, extending and repurposing code snippets
- Transform semi-structured JSON data to structured data sets for statistical analysis ("parsing")
- Store and manage data using file-based systems <!--and databases-->
- Draft, execute, monitor and audit online data collections locally and remotely
- Document and archive collected data, and make it available for public (re)use
- Track and share progress on the course's learning goals

## Format

- Hybrid format: Jupyter notebooks or pre-recorded web clips for preparation and self-paced lab sessions; live streams on Zoom for feedback and joint coding sessions (recordings will be made available)
- Modern content: copy-paste code snippets and demos from the course page, access code on GitHub, start projects with templates from GitHub, share screens and solve problems
- Interactive, immersive and student-centred: live coding, debates, open-source content contributions, scraping real websites and accessing real APIs

<!--, simulations, hackathon-->
<!-- work on VMs on AWS, code in SQL and R, compete on Kaggle, or work on own computer--; Coding Dojo student-=led analysis; while sharing screens-->

## Student profile / prerequisites

- The course is instructed to MSc students in the Marketing Analytics (TiSEM) program.
- The course expects students to have acquired working knowledge in Python (e.g., from introductory courses at Datacamp), including an understanding of data types (e.g., characters, integers), loops, if-else statements, and functions.
- The course welcomes novices, of whom extra preparation prior to the start of the course is expected. Preparation material will be shared with students in advance in the form of Jupyter Notebooks or course recommendations at Datacamp. Novices may further benefit from following other courses at Tilburg University in which Python is used, for example, *Research Skills: Data Processing* and *Research Skills: Data Processing Advanced*.
- Students are recommended to use their own computer for this course (Windows, Mac or Linux). Android/Chromebook/iOS devices are not supported.

<!--We will review the basics during induction week, but the pace will be very brisk.

## Grading

- [Team project](project) (40%)
- Individual contribution to team project (10%)
- Share individual progress and learnings (10%)
- Computer exam (40%)

Students pass this course if the final course grade (i.e., the weighted average of the individual components; weights indicated above) is ≥ 5.5, and the exam is passed (≥ 5.5). Final course grades are rounded to multiples of half points (e.g., 6, 6.5, 7, etc.).

### Team project

Students will submit a [final team project (4-5 team members)](project) at the end of the course.

### Individual contribution to team project

Students individual contribution to the team project will be equal to the overall team grade, corrected upwards or downwards depending on
their effort. To measure effort, team members score themselves and their team members on, among others, the quantity and quality of their contributions.

{{< hint info >}}
__Calculation of individual contribution to team project__

1. Students score themselves and other team members on the following questions (answered on a scale between 1 = lowest, and 5 = highest)
  - How was the pro-active attitude of the student?
  - How was the student as a team player?
  - How was the sense of responsibility of the student?
  - How was the punctuality of the student with respect to internal deadlines?
  - How was the time and energy devoted of this student?
  - How was the quantity of the contribution of the student?
  - How was the quality of the contribution of the student?

2. Compute average score from (1) for each student within a team, across all questions. ("How did team members rate the focal student?")

3. Compute average team effort score, by averaging (within each team) the scores obtained in (2). ("What was the overall team effort?")

4. Compute students' self- and peer assessment score (`SPAscore`), by dividing each student's score by the team average. ("How did the student perform, relative to the overall team effort?"

5. Multiply the team project grade with the `SPAscore`, to arrive at the individual contribution to the team project.

### Share individual progress and learnings

Sharing one's progress and learnings in class is a crucial component of the course. Students can submit, during the course, their works for use in class or by other students.

Works encompass:
- material for use during a live stream (e.g., data availability assessments for projects),
- maintaining a public FAQ/blog sharing one's progress, and
- open science contribution in the form of PRs to GitHub.

Students receive a pass on this component for submitting at least one piece of work during the course, via Canvas.
