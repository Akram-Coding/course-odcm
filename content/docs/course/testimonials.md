# Student acknowledgement

To get an idea of how students of previous editions of this course thought of this course, we included some of main points that were mentioned in the course evaluation by them below.

## About the course
- _This course has significantly improved my
coding skills. Hannes took the time to look at our
code in multiple coaching sessions. He was also
always available through Whatsapp etc. I also
appreciate the effort he took into making pulse (a
website tracking your progress). The example code
in Google Colab was also very helpful. Also,
Hannes is a very inspiring teacher who really
encouraged us to go the extra mile_

- _Its relevant and the contents are closely linked
to what is expected later on in the programme, this
fit makes the course in my opinion an excellent fit
with marketing analytics and it is very usefull later
in life, compared to other courses that fully focus
on theoretical learning_

- _I was positively surprised that Tilburg
University teaches scraping skills. I’ve never heard
of any other university teaching that. It’s also
forward-thinking: these skills will be useful in the
future. I’d never start learning scraping on my own
because I always though it’s very complicated but
it turns out to be doable. Pulse is a nice a nice
addition to the course since there isn’t a book that
would teach us that. Team consults were useful
with solving the code issues. I like that the teacher
is passionate about what he teaches._

- _Pretty cool skills I obtained from this class.
Couldn't imagine I would know how to scrape data
online_

## About the team project and tutorials

- _I really liked the setup of this course. Figuring
out what to do for the project yourselves really
inspired and motivated everyone to do their best._

- _The structure was really nice. The assignments
and tutorials aligned very well with the project. It
was really nice to put things in practice._

- _The course has clear objectives and is a great
introduction on data collection with scraping and
APi's. The google colabs give a very nice
structured assignment to prepare and get familiar
with the material._
