- Exam registration: not necessary; enrollment to the Canvas course page is sufficient
- Inspection: tba <!--(signup here: https://forms.gle/6y5q66tsJzsGN59b9, Zoom link see Canvas)-->

### Resit
- Date: __Monday, 17 January 2022__
- Time: __9.00am - 12pm (i.e., 11.59am + 1 minute)__ (Amsterdam time, you can start when you want, but *must* submit before the deadline)
- Registration: tba <!--by 7 June 2021 at the latest, via https://forms.gle/KXQBjtTvY9saQQhS8.-->

## Technicalities & support

- Receiving your exam: via [TestVision](https://TilburgU.testvision.nl/online/kandidaten) on the day of the exam
- Working on your exam: on your own computer
- Submitting your exam: all questions (including file uploads) will be submitted via TestVision
- Registration: not necessary; enrollment to the Canvas course page is sufficient
- Support during the exam: preferably WhatsApp [see the support section of this website](support); Support only for "unforeseen" errors. No support will be given for technical issues that students *should* have solved during the course (e.g., installation of Anaconda, running Jupyter Notebook, etc.)

## Form

- Open book take-home exam (i.e., you can access any material you find helpful, including the material you have stored on your computers or that you find on the internet).
- Mix of open and closed questions (both in writing, or by means of code/file uploads)
- Some questions will be personalized (i.e., there is only one correct answer per student), others will be randomized (i.e., you will see questions in mixed order, and not all students get to see all questions).

{{< hint warning >}}
__Communication with anybody about the exam content, during *and after* the take-home exam, is strictly prohibited.__

## Content

### Part 1: Theory

- This part of the exam consists of __personalized open and closed (multiple-choice) questions__, shown in __random order__. The dominant question type is __open questions__.
- Students __*cannot* go back between questions__ (i.e., questions need to be answered in the order they appear).
- Allocate approximately 45 minutes to work on this part, which predominately focuses on the workflow for collecting web data ("Fields of Gold" paper)
- Cognitive skills that will be tested are knowledge, comprehension, and analysis.

### Part 2: Practical

- This part of the exam consists of __personalized open questions__, shown in __random order__.
- Students can go freely back and forth between questions in this part.
- Allocate approximately 2:15 minutes to work on this part, which focuses on all course learning goals.
- Expect three broad questions
  - Small coding task (e.g., parsing, fixing errors, running existing code) (20 minutes)
  - Small essay to form a judgment (e.g., recommend website or API for a particular business problem, evaluate terms & conditions, sample size calculations) (20 minutes)
  - Large(r) coding task (e.g., scrape data from a website or retrieve data from API) (remaining time, about 1 hour and 30 minutes)
- Cognitive skills that will be tested are application, evaluation, and synthesis/creation.
- All tutorials (except *advanced web scraping* and *advanced APIs* are relevant for this part of the exam).

## Preparing for the exam

### Work on the example questions

Please [view the list of example questions here](examplequestions).

### Make your own example questions

- We encourage you to generate your own example questions. Just start from a combination of learning goals (e.g., learn how to scrape, "web scraping 101") and cognitive skill levels (e.g., "evaluation"). Combining these two dimensions will help you come up with a creative way of asking a good example question.
- See [this summary of Bloom's Taxonomy](https://mygrowthmindsethome.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/blooms-taxonomy.pdf), which we also use to generate exam questions.
- Curious whether your question is "good" - [send it to us via the usual ways](../support) - maybe it will even be part of the exam? ;)

### Familiarize yourself with TestVision

- [Take a practice test](https://oefentoetsen.testvision.nl/online/fe/login_ot.htm?campagne=tlb_demo_eng&taal=2) to familiarize yourself with TestVision!
- Get to know more about TestVision [here](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/studying/exams/e-assessment/testvision)

### Technical tips & beyond

- Verify your software setup (you should be able to run all Jupyter Notebooks/tutorials on your own computer)
- Know how to zip and unzip files
- Make use of cheat sheets (e.g., available on this site or elsewhere) (you can also print them)
- Revise your code before submission in part 2 so that you ensure it runs from top to bottom without problems.
