# Activity #3: Data Availability Assessment and Evaluation of Research Fit

## Overview

- Type: Document in tabular format (see Tables W3.1 and W3.2 in "Fields of Gold"), and an Excel sheet (see Table W3.3 in "Fields of Gold")

- Before starting, carefully reread the relevant sections in "Fields of Gold" on how to assess which data is available on the site, and how to evaluate whether the data fits your research purpose.

## Tasks

- Prepare a short document, covering
  - Title page: Team number & brief description of motivation for data context
  - Section 1: answering the questions for your chosen website/API(s), as shown in Table W3.1 from "Fields of Gold"
  - Section 2: answering the questions for your chosen website/API(s), as shown in Table W3.2 from "Fields of Gold"

- Prepare an Excel sheet, covering
  - a copy of Table W3.3 from "Fields of Gold", in which you calculate your study's feasible sample size. Alternatively, use the Excel sheet to calibrate the various parameters to make it fit your study (e.g., to calibrate the tradeoff between sampling frequency and sample size).

## Submission

- Please upload the document (as a PDF) and Excel sheet (as an Excel file) in one zip file at the latest by 8am on the day of the live stream. Use Canvas.
