# Activity #1: Generating Project Ideas

## Overview
- Type: Breakout activity
- Duration: 15 minutes in breakout group, 15-20 minutes post-discussion with the entire group.
- Goals
  - identify online data sources and evaluate their value in the context of a specific societal or business problem
  - start the group formation process (but do not have to commit at this moment)
  - summarize the result of your discussion for the entire group

## Preparation before the breakout activity

- Read ["Fields of Gold"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3820666) and learn how to identify impactful and novel web data!
- It may be most effective to organize your data selection in a shared Google Document (so you can all add notes at the same time).

## Breakout session structure

1. Introduction
    - Choose a team captain who will take notes and *may* have to present the breakout group's findings to the large group.
    - If you haven't done so - introduce yourselves to each other briefly
        - "What are you passionate about (e.g., hobbies)?"
        - "Where do you spend your time online?"
        - "What's your biggest (personal, business or study) challenge right now?"

2. Come up with an interesting *data context* that provides researchers with novel data for studying novel phenomena, enhancing ecological value, improving methods, or enhancing inferences.

3. Start to broadly identify data sources to solve the societal/business challenge(s).
    - In exploring the data universe, beware of the common challenges that occur in data selection: threat of defaulting, only considering web scraping, considering the contextual complexity.

__Diversity & inclusion matters!__

While we try to start the conversation about potential topics to work on around specific themes, we ask you not to feel restricted by those. In fact, what really matters here is that you bring in your passion (e.g., hobby), background (e.g., nationality, ethnicity), or any other thing that you consider part of yourself. In other words, let's bring alive Tilburg's statement of diversity and inclusion. If you're really into scraping Amazon.com, that's fine. But if you're more interested in that niche platform that you and some of your friends hang out on, feel welcome to do that! We're not just here to do what others have done in the past, but we're here to move our field along. And we won't be able to do that without talking about and doing the things that you truely care about.

Please also check out the [syllabus for some more information on how diversity & inclusion matters in this class](../../../syllabus).
