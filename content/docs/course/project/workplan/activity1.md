# Activity #1: Generating Project Ideas

## Overview
- Type: Breakout activity
- Duration: 30 minutes in breakout group, 15-20 minutes post-discussion with the entire group.
- Goals
  - identify online data sources and evaluate their value in the context of a specific societal or business problem
  - facilitate getting to know each other
  - start the group formation process (but do not have to commit at this moment)
  - summarize the result of your discussion for the entire group

## Preparation before the breakout activity

- Read ["Fields of Gold"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3820666) and learn how to identify impactful and novel web data!
- During the live stream, you'll be allocated to three groups: society, business, and trendsetter. Can you think of relevant data sources (e.g., websites, APIs) that spark your interest?
- Take some notes, and be prepared to pitch a site or context to other students. Your input will be used to facilitate group formation for the team project.


## Breakout session structure

1. Choose a team captain who will take notes and *may* have to present the breakout group's findings to the large group.
2. Introduce yourselves to each other! (about 5 minutes)
    - "What are you passionate about (e.g., hobbies)?"
    - "Where do you live?"
    - "Where do you spend your time online?"
    - "What's your biggest (personal, business or study) challenge right now?"

3. Explore your "breakout challenge" (about 10 minutes)
    - Group "society": Come up with a list of the three most important *societal challenges* of today. Find challenges that you also personally find important. Get inspired, e.g., by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, but feel free to go in a completely different direction!
    - Group "business": Come up with a list of the three most important *business challenges* of today. Discuss challenges that you also personally care about. Seek inspiration, e.g., in the business press, at the websites of agencies (e.g., Accenture, etc.).
    - Group "trendsetter": Discuss in your group about trends that *you* think will become extremely big in the near future! Think Google in 2006, Twitter in 2010, Spotify in 2012, self-driving cars in 202x?, etc. "What's still small but will become *big* and important (e.g., revenue, impact on society, etc.) soon?!"
4. Have your team members do some background research and come up with a list of websites and APIs in a joint Google Docs/Slides (about 15 minutes). Think about ways in which such websites or APIs could __help you as marketers to contribute to solving those__.
5. Be able to summarize and present the result of your work (i.e., the challenges/trends, with corresponding websites and APIs) to the entire group.
