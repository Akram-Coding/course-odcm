# Activity #1: Generating Project Ideas

## Overview
- Type: Breakout activity
- Duration: 30 minutes in breakout group, 15-20 minutes post-discussion with the entire group.
- Goals
  - identify online data sources and evaluate their value in the context of a specific societal or business problem
  - facilitate getting to know each other
  - start the group formation process (but do not have to commit at this moment)
  - summarize the result of your discussion for the entire group

## Preparation before the breakout activity

- Read ["Fields of Gold"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3820666) and learn how to identify impactful and novel web data!
- During the live stream, you can choose an initial theme: society (e.g., societal impact), business (e.g., new business model), and trendsetter (e.g., new digital platform). Can you think of relevant data sources (e.g., websites, APIs) that spark your interest?
- Take some notes, and be prepared to pitch a site or context to other students. Your input will be used to facilitate group formation for the team project.

__Diversity & inclusion matters!__

While we try to start the conversation about potential topics to work on around specific themes, we ask you not to feel restricted by those. In fact, what really matters here is that you bring in your passion (e.g., hobby), background (e.g., nationality, ethnicity), or any other thing that you consider part of yourself. In other words, let's bring alive Tilburg's statement of diversity and inclusion. If you're really into scraping Amazon.com, that's fine. But if you're more interested in that niche platform that you and some of your friends hang out on, feel welcome to do that! We're not just here to do what others have done in the past, but we're here to move our field along. And we won't be able to do that without talking about and doing the things that you truely care about.

Please also check out the [syllabus for some more information on how diversity & inclusion matters in this class](../../../syllabus).

## Breakout session structure

1. Choose a team captain who will take notes and *may* have to present the breakout group's findings to the large group.
2. Introduce yourselves to each other! (about 5 minutes)
    - "What are you passionate about (e.g., hobbies)?"
    - "Where do you live?"
    - "Where do you spend your time online?"
    - "What's your biggest (personal, business or study) challenge right now?"

3. Explore your "breakout challenge" (about 10 minutes)
    - Group "society": Come up with a list of the three most important *societal challenges* of today. Find challenges that you also personally find important. Get inspired, e.g., by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, but feel free to go in a completely different direction!
    - Group "business": Come up with a list of the three most important *business challenges* of today. Discuss challenges that you also personally care about. Seek inspiration, e.g., in the business press, at the websites of agencies (e.g., Accenture, etc.).
    - Group "trendsetter": Discuss in your group about trends that *you* think will become extremely big in the near future! Think Google in 2006, Twitter in 2010, Spotify in 2012, self-driving cars in 202x?, etc. "What's still small but will become *big* and important (e.g., revenue, impact on society, etc.) soon?!"
4. Have your team members do some background research and come up with a list of websites and APIs in a joint Google Docs/Slides (about 15 minutes). Think about ways in which such websites or APIs could __help you as marketers to contribute to solving those__.
5. Be able to summarize and present the result of your work (i.e., the challenges/trends, with corresponding websites and APIs) to the entire group.
