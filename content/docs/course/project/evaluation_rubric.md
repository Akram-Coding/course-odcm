# Evaluation Rubric

You can use the evaluation rubric below to understand how you are evaluated in this group assignment, and how we judge an element to be e.g. insufficient, good, or excellent. Further, you can use it to get detailed feedback on your performance once results are known, and learn about improvements you could make. Your final grade is computed as the sum of all points.

| | No/limited proficiency (0 points) | Some proficiency (0.5 points) | Adequate proficiency (1 point) | High proficiency (1.5 points) |
| :--- | :--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Research Question   |  The research question is way too broad, so that it cannot be answered in your current context; furthermore, its additional value to stakeholders (which stakeholders?) are unclear or undiscussed; clear implications are absent, and reasoning is insufficiently backed up by facts or figures. | The research question deserves some merit, but many obstacles remain to clearly convince the reader of the added value of answering this question. This may either be because the question is not specific enough, or because there is a lack of sufficient arguments or context in explaining the RQ (e.g., additional value, to whom, backing up by figures or facts, etc.).  |  The research question is adequate. However, students may have not succeeded in formulating the additional value for specific stakeholders (e.g. managers, consumers, policy makers), have not provided convincing examples, or the arguments which the RQ is based on are not backed up by facts or figures sufficiently. | Clearly formulated a research question (not too broad), and explained how research adds additional value to specific stakeholders (e.g. managers, consumers, policy makers); provided convincing examples with clear implications, and arguments are backed up by facts or figures. |
| Data Collection | Raw and cleaned data are not present | - | Raw and cleaned data are present | -  |
| Data Transformation  |  Jupyter Notebook does not run and/or does not parse due to some or more mistakes in the script, i.e. a large part of the data is lost in parsing, some incomplete rows are included in the output file, or multiple parsing scripts are submitted, crucial information is missing, etc. | Jupyter Notebook runs and parses the data. However, some mistakes and/or inefficiencies are still present in the script; e.g. parsing mistakes, commands that do not lead to a change in the output file, multiple error handling commands whilst this could have been done at once, skipping some lines that should have been included, replacing text multiple times in a row, script provides an unstructured output file (e.g. some incomplete rows are included in the output file), messy data as result.  | Jupyter Notebook runs and parses the data. However, a few inefficiencies are still present in the script; e.g. multiple error handling commands that wrap large chunks of code, replacing text multiple times in a row, inefficient document names etc. | Jupyter Notebook runs and parses the data. The Notebook is clearly structured, every command optimally formulated and adds to the actual outcome. Script is free of mistakes or any inefficient decisions. Script uses efficient error handlings and clearly formulated input and output files.  |
| Data Distribution  |  The documentation is missing or largely incomplete | -  | The documentation is available and complete  | -  |
| Reporting | Students did not adhere to the mandatory format (i.e. number of pages, font type, spacing, the use of the title page etc.). Ideas, recommendations etc. are poorly or unclearly motivated. The text is insufficiently structured. Inconsistencies and errors in interpretation are common, crucial information is missing.  |  Some parts of the mandatory format are not included, e.g. number of pages, font type, spacing, the use of the title page etc. Overall, some textual ideas or recommendations are not coherently motivated, more argumentation and structure would’ve been beneficial, and some inconsistencies or misinterpretations might be present along with the lack of some crucial information. | Students adhered to the mandatory format (i.e. number of pages, font type, spacing, the use of the title page etc. is correct). However, some ideas, recommendations etc. should’ve been motivated more strongly, text is structured to a certain extent but more structure would’ve been beneficial to the reader. Some inconsistencies and interpretation errors may still be present but no crucial info is missing.  | Students adhered to the mandatory format (i.e. number of pages, font type, spacing, the use of the title page etc. is correct). Ideas, recommendations etc. are sufficiently motivated. The text is presented in a structured manner, statements are coherent and consistent. Results and conclusions follow logically from the research question. No crucial info is missing. |
