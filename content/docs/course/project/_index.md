# Team Project

## Goal

Collecting data via web scraping and APIs requires practice. Together with your team members, you plan and execute an online data collection throughout the course, and submit your collected (and documented) data at the end of the course.

__The focus lies on *completing the complete workflow for collecting web data*. Keep each stage of your project *manageable* and *feasible*.__

## Getting started

- [Seek inspiration for project ideas](projectideas), and [explore the examples](../../examples)
- [Discover how to submit your project, and how you will be graded](grading)
- [Check out the workplan and team activities](workplan)

## Team composition

- 4-5 students per team
- you need to subscribe to a team yourself (be present in the live streams for that; registration on Canvas!)
- we recommend teams to have at least one-two students with coding expertise in Python on their team

## Deadline and submission
- Deadline: {{< param "Course_Deadline_Project" >}}
- Submission of your [data package](grading) via [Surf Filesender](https://filesender.surf.nl)
  - send to h.datta@tilburguniversity.edu in one zip file (one email per team)


<!--
- If you are also taking ["Data Preparation and Workflow Management" (dPrep)](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com)...
  - You can use the data collected in this course for the team project in dPrep. The team project in dPrep runs in weeks 6-8, but you definitely need your raw data in week 5 at the latest (to prep well for week 6). In other words: generating some synergies between dPrep and oDCM comes at the cost of working on this project soon enough!
  - Please submit your entire workflow ("the same submissions") for each of the two courses, consisting of
    - your data collection, the raw data, and its documentation (focus of oDCM), and
    - the entire project pipeline (focus of dPrep, consisting of data exploration, data preparation, automation and deployment).
  - For oDCM, please *zip* your entire pipeline (so we're sure to get all the files for grading).
  - For dPrep, please only provide us with the link to your GitHub repository.
