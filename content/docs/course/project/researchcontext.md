# Research Context

Skilling up in web scraping and APIs requires practice, and conducting a group project is a great way to learn more about any facet of data- or computer science. Choose one of the following questions to explore further or pitch your own one during one of the live meetings in the course!

## Project ideas

Here's a list with a couple of examples to get you started. Don't feel restricted by these options, though! There are plenty of other great ideas, and we encourage you to think of applications in which you use two or more APIs or where you combine web scraping with a relevant API.

1. [Spotifycharts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional)
    - Compare the rankings across countries throughout time (2017-2021)
      - How long do tracks typically stay in the top 200?
      - Are the Spotify top 200 charts similar to [YouTube Music charts](https://charts.youtube.com)?
      - What is the relative market share of music streaming in comparison to global figures?
      - Can tracks that fell off the track, bounce back and climb up the rankings again?
      - Can you find clusters of countries that share the same music taste?
      - Do the total number of streams significantly fluctuate throughout time?

2. [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse) & [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com)
    - Which movie genres are most popular, and are most likely to be trending?
    - Are Netflix originals promoted more often on the homescreen than other movies?
    - Are the highest rated movies also the ones most popular on Netflix?
    - If you go this route, make sure your whole team has access to Netflix!

3. [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)
    - What are the most popular types of YouTube channels in terms of views?
    - Did watchtime and views go up for these channels since the COVID-19 outbreak?
    - Do the channels with the most subscribers also earn the most? (e.g., see [Socialblade](https://socialblade.com/youtube/))
    - What factors play a role in determining the "Socialblade" channel grade?
    - How can you identify upcoming Youtubers that show great potential for an advertising partnership?

4. Competitor Analysis
   - Scrape products from, for example, [bol.com](bol.com) and [Coolblue](coolblue.nl)
     - Are our tech products priced lower than our competitors?
     - Are the same products on sale at the same time?
     - Are customer reviews comparable across platforms?
     - How are products ordered by default?


5. Any of the real-world examples used throughout the course:
   - Webscraping
     - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com)
     - [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) (you can also use their streaming [API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)!)

   - API
     - [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
     - [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

6. Your own research
    - e.g., a custom project for your research
