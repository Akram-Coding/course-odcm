      - Are the Spotify top 200 charts similar to [YouTube Music charts](https://charts.youtube.com)?
      - What is the relative market share of music streaming in comparison to global figures?
      - Can tracks that fell off the track, bounce back and climb up the rankings again?

      - Do the total number of streams significantly fluctuate throughout time?
