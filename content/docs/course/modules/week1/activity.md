# Live Stream Activity: Ideation

You will perform this activity during live stream #2.

## Overview
- Type: Breakout activity
- Duration: 25 minutes in breakout group, 15 minutes post-discussion with the entire group.
- Goals
  - identify online data sources and evaluate their value in the context of a specific societal or business problem
  - help you getting to know each other
  - start the group formation process (still very lose at this moment)

## Breakout session structure

1. Choose a team captain who will take notes and present the breakout group's findings to the large group.
2. Introduce yourselves to each other! (5 minutes)
    - "Where do you live?"
    - "What are you passionate about (e.g., hobbies)?"
    - "Where do you spend your time online?"
3. Discuss your "challenge" (10 minutes)
    - Group "society": Come up with a list of the three most important *societal challenges* of today. You don't have to just copy-paste them from the web, but discuss among each other what *you* personally find important.
    - Group "business": Come up with a list of the three most important *business challenges* of today. You don't have to just copy-paste them from the web, but discuss among each other what *you* personally find important.
    - Group "trendsetter": Discuss in your group about trends that *you* think will become big in the near future! Think Google in 2006, Twitter in 2010, Spotify in 2012, etc. "What's still small but will become *big* and important (e.g., revenue, impact on society, etc.) soon?!"
4. Have your team members do some background research and come up with a list of websites and APIs in a joint Google Docs (15 minutes).
5. Summarize your findings (e.g., the challenges/trends, with corresponding websites and APIs), and present it to the entire group after the activity ends.
