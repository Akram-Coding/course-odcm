# Week 2: Data availability and research fit

## Self-study
- Workflow for collecting online data (Tutorial)
  - [Data Availability Assessment](docs/tutorials/workflow/dataassessment.md)
  - [Evaluation of Research Fit](docs/tutorials/workflow/researchfit.md)

## Activities
- Finalize teams (sign-up options are on Canvas)
  - 4-5 students per team
- Get to know each other
  - Before meeting up as a team, please individually take [a personality test](https://www.123test.com/team-roles-test/) - will you be the team's *driver*, or rather perform important tasks as an *analyst*?
  - You can schedule unlimited Zoom calls by logging on to Zoom with your Tilburg login credentials (choose: SSO, enter `tilburguniversity` as the domain)
  - During your first meeting, spend a good amount of time getting to know each other, *welcoming* new members to the group (e.g., those that signed up later), and telling about the result of your personality test (and whether you agree or disagree!)
- Work on your Data Availability and Research Fit assessment
  - As per the workflow for collection online data (see above), please create a 3-slide presentation per team.
    - Slide 1: Research question & explanation on its importance
    - Slide 2: Data availability assessment
    - Slide 3: Evaluation of Research Fit and Resource Use
  - Submission
    - Please upload the slide deck both as a PDF and as a Powerpoint (in one zip file) by Friday, 8.30am (Canvas).
  - Tips
      - Slides will not be used for *presenting*, so they can be relatively text-heavy ("McKinsey slides", rather than presentable "five bullets max")
      - Slide decks will be used in interactive live stream.
      - Indicate your team number on the slides!
