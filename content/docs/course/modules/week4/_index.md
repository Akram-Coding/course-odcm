# Week 4: Data Extraction Plan

## Live stream 4
- Tutorial Q&A for [web scraping 101](docs/tutorials/webscraping101) and [APIs 101](docs/tutorials/apis101)
  - Re-watch [part 1 - introduction](https://youtu.be/GtkOC28O25I)
  - Re-watch [part 2 - web scraping 101](https://youtu.be/DpiLsc62f0E)
  - Re-watch [part 3 - APIs 101](https://youtu.be/e8sLCx1HXnY))

## Self-study
- Workflow for collecting online data (Tutorial)
  - [Technical Extraction Plan and Prototyping](docs/tutorials/workflow/extraction-plan-prototyping.md)
  - [Evaluate Legal and Ethical Concerns](docs/tutorials/workflow/legalfit.md)
  <!--- Design choices: modularity and storage *prerecorded*
  - Data capture and enrichment *prerecorded*
  - Deployment *prerecorded*
- Legal and ethical considerations when scraping <!-- *reading* [tba]-->
- Optional: Watch this screen cast in which I try to figure out how to [obtain data from an API that I haven't seen before](https://youtu.be/iDA710TPXT0)
  - The video may be particularly useful to students who wish to extract data from an API for their team projects.

## Activities

- Please work on your [technical extraction plan](docs/tutorials/workflow/extraction-plan-prototyping.md), and assess the [legal and ethical concerns](docs/tutorials/workflow/legalfit.md) of your data collection project.
- You *can* submit - for live feedback - one or more of the following works. Note that it is not *mandatory* to upload material. Instead, the submissions should be seen as a way to receive feedback on your projects.

  - A short slide deck (max. 2 slides), in which you show which __entities you plan on getting (+ its extraction frequency)__, and what __particular variables__ you plan on selecting.
    - When submitting, please label your files as `entities_teamXX.pptx` and `entities_teamXX.pdf`.
  - A short slide deck (max. 2 slides), in which you explain the __seeding strategy and sampling procedure__.
    - When submitting, please label your files as `seeding_teamXX.pptx` and `seeding_teamXX.pdf`.
  - A short slide deck (max. 2 slides), in which you detail any __ethical or legal concerns__ of your data collection.
      - When submitting, please label your files as `legal_teamXX.pptx` and `legal_teamXX.pdf`.
  - A __short screencast__ (max. 2 minutes), in which you *visualize* your __navigation path__. Your raw recording can be longer than 2 minutes, BUT, you are required to trim it to 2 minutes in the final submission. In other words - we recommend you cut "silent moments" (e.g., when a website is being loaded).
      - When submitting, please label your file as `navigation_teamXX.mp4` (or any other video format).
  - A __prototype script__ (Jupyter Notebook, or `.py` file) that demonstrates the first steps in writing your data extraction/scraping code. You can also use your script to illustrate some of the technical hurdles you are facing. Please test whether the script/Notebook runs correctly (e.g., open it on another computer, and run it top to down). Upload the files in a compressed archive, please. Make use of comments in your code to point users to problems.
      - When submitting, please label your file as `scraper_teamXX.ipynb` or `scraper_teamXX.py`.

- Submission
  - Please upload your work in one zip file by Friday, 8.00am (Canvas).
  - Tips
      - Slides will not be used for *presenting*, so they can be relatively text-heavy ("McKinsey slides", rather than presentable "five bullets max")
      - Slide decks, screencasts and code will be used in the interactive live stream. Make sure others can understand your work (e.g., by using comments, being sufficiently elaborate)!
      - Indicate your team number in the file names.

## Live stream 5
- Discussing the components of your technical extraction plan
- Building a first prototype
- Debating on legal and ethical concerns
