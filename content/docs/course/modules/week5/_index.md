# Week 5: Skill-building <!--+ feedback-->

<!--- Present data extraction plan for chosen website + feedback
<!--*live; same "smaller" groups like before*-->

## Self-study

- Workflow for collecting online data (Tutorial)
  - [Data Collection and Debugging](docs/tutorials/workflow/collection.md)
- Skill development (choose at least one tutorial, on the basis of your group project)
  - [Advanced Web Scraping](docs/tutorials/webscrapingadvanced)
  - [Advanced APIs](docs/tutorials/apisadvanced)
- Check out [Hannes' YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYef2_7EscmOfwl-2G7mIrg) for any added screencasts/coaching sessions with other students.

## Activities

- Please continue to work on the development of your prototype. Importantly, integrate your learnings from the advanced tutorials above in your team project where necessary.
- You *can* submit - for live feedback - your __prototype script__ (e.g., Python script `.py`, Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb`). Note that it is not *mandatory* to upload material. Instead, the submissions should be seen as a way to receive feedback on your projects. Typical problems at this stage of your team projects are:
    - How to navigate from one entity to another?
    - How to loop through multiple search result pages?
    - How to capture specific data points (e.g., how to locate it using a combination of tag words, CSS selectors, etc.)
    - How to deal with technical hurdles (e.g., authentication, logging in on a site, scrolling)
    - How to store the data while it is being scraped/collected?
- Submission
  - Please upload your work in one zip file by Friday, 7.45am (Canvas).
  - Tips
      - Please structure your notebook in a way to understand the envisioned navigation path, and which entities (and corresponding data) you wish to capture.
      - Please make use of Markdown cells to describe your problems concisely. Use headers (`# Header`, `## Subheader`), and formatting (`__bold__`, `*italic*`) where appropriate.
      - Indicate your team number in the file names, and __whether your submission is a scraper or API__ (e.g., `scraper_teamXX.ipynb`, `api_teamXX.ipynb`).

## Live streams 6a and 6b
Please join (at least) one of the two live streams:

### Live stream 6a
- Feedback on prototype submissions (web scraping)
- Tutorial Q&A for Advanced Web Scraping

### Live stream 6b
- Feedback on prototype submissions (APIs)
- Tutorial Q&A for Advanced APIs
