  <!--

  - Generate groups on the fly: academic versus business; API vs. web scraping; substantive areas in which you're interested; initial research ideas

  - Create break-out groups: 20-30m of discussion
  - Leading questions:
    - What's hot right now?
    - What are important phenomena?
    - What excites you about research?
    - Which websites do you spend a lot of time on?
    - What websites would be cool to monitor today?
    - Have you used an API before?
    - Have you stumbled upon some interesting documentation?

    - What excites you?
    - Search for websites: what do they show?
    - Search for APIs: what do they show? Are they accessible?
    - Why is it an important phenomena, whom does it affect?

  - Come back in the "big room" + quick presentation + feedback

  - The result is a board with websites, and people that are interested in it
  - Subscribe to at least 3 data sources.

  - Together with other team members, fill in the "steckbrief" of these sites

  <!--[split by academic research/ topic, vs. business): generating ideas for potential data sources / phenomena ("what's hot right now? What are important phenomena?", "what excites you about a potential area? what would be cool websites to monitor today?"

  - Discuss: in which area does it fall? are people monitoring that site already? what capture would you hope to achieve? is this more "investment in data?"/"timeliness", or more robustness? is this more a covariate or a key thing?
