## Structure

The exam covers both a theoretical and practical component. The former involves a set of multiple choice questions to be completed on TestVision. The latter tests students' ability to scrape specified fields from an interactive website, quickly get up to a speed with an API they have never used before, read its documentation, and go through a series of multi-step problems.

#### 1. Theory (50%)
- Mix of multiple choice and open questions
  - 40 points MC (about 16-20 questions)
  - 10 points open questions (3-4 questions)

#### 2. Practical (50%)
- Multi-probems covering both the web scraping and APIs tutorials
- Question about the team project


Note: the exact number of points and questions on the exam may vary slightly.


<!-- POST-COVID

* Downloading files (C:\users\[your username]) versus Jupyter’s default startup directory (c:\users\default) – practice that!

* Websites blocked, except [jsonviewer.stack.hu](jsonviewer.stack.hu)

* Be there about 15 minutes earlier to start up your computer

* Find programs via the start menu – do not install Jupyter or any package yourself
