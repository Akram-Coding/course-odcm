# Week 2: Workflow & learning how to scrape

## Kick-starting your week
- Watch the kick-off for the week - TBA!

## Self-study and activities

- Please carefully read ["Fields of Gold: Generating Relevant and Credible Insights Via Web Scraping and APIs"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3820666).
  - This paper will be your guiding framework for the rest of this course, and chance is you'll have to read it a couple of times (e.g., first to get an overview, and later to appreciate and use the details in your project). The web appendix contains valuable tables, so don't skip them.

- [Web data retrieval for dummies (Tutorial)](docs/tutorials/webdata-for-dummies)
- Please prepare [breakout activity #1](../../../docs/course/project/workplan/activity1.md).
