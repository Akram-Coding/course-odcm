# Week 5: Prototype Development
<!--Skill-building <!--+ feedback-->

<!--- Present data extraction plan for chosen website + feedback
<!--*live; same "smaller" groups like before*-->

## Kick-starting your week
- [Watch the kick-off for the week](https://youtu.be/u4TD4i_hsl0)

## Tutorial
{{% laptop %}}

- Team presentations ([activity #3](../../project/workplan/activity3)) & feedback

## Coaching session

- Please start working on [team activity #4](/docs/project/workplan/activity4.md)

<!--- Optional: Still wonder why APIs are so powerful? Read [Zalando's take](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#introduction) on APIs
-->


## Self-study and activities

- Keep on refining your project. For example, your team can work on the implementation of the scraping/API extraction while the instructor is providing feedback and help whenever required.
  - Start fiddling around with accessing your chosen website or API. 
  - Start building an initial prototype to extract some data (doesn't need to be the "final" data yet!)
