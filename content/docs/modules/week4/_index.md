# Week 4: Data Availability Assessment, Research Fit, Legal Audit

## Self-study
- Review the previous tutorials, and start fiddling around with accessing your chosen website or API.
- Conduct some background search/research on the current legal situation on using web scraping and APIs

__Looking for a challenge? [optional]__

If you feel you don't just want to stick with the basics but would like to learn *more*, then you can choose to follow some of the tutorials below. This material will *not* be covered on the exam, but you can certainly use it for your projects.
  - [Advanced Web Scraping](docs/tutorials/webscrapingadvanced)
  - [Advanced APIs](docs/tutorials/apisadvanced)
- Check out [Hannes' YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYef2_7EscmOfwl-2G7mIrg) for any added screencasts/coaching sessions with other students, either from this year, or from previous years.

## Activities
- Please prepare [Team Activity #3](../../../docs/course/project/workplan/activity3.md).
- If you've got some spare time left, try fiddling around with code to extract some data from your chosen website or API.

  - Data capture and enrichment *prerecorded*
  - Deployment *prerecorded*
- Legal and ethical considerations when scraping <!-- *reading* [tba]-->

<!--
- Optional: Watch this screen cast in which I try to figure out how to [obtain data from an API that I haven't seen before](https://youtu.be/iDA710TPXT0)
  - The video may be particularly useful to students who wish to extract data from an API for their team projects.
