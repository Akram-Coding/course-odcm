# Week 4: Learn how to extract data from APIs
<!--Data Availability Assessment, Research Fit, Legal Audit

Data Availability and Research Fit
description: Assess which data is available at your chosen data source, and whether it fits your research purpose.

-->
## Kick-starting your week
- Watch the kick-off for the week - TBA!

## Self-study and activities

- [APIs 101 (Tutorial)](docs/tutorials/apis101)
- Start fiddling around with accessing your chosen website or API. If you have time left, start building an initial prototype to extract some data (doesn't need to be the "final" data yet!)
- Please prepare [Team Activity #3](../../../docs/project/workplan/activity3.md).
- Optional: Still wonder why APIs are so powerful? Read [Zalando's take](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#introduction) on APIs

## Live stream 4
- [Team Activity #3](../../../docs/project/workplan/activity3.md)


<!--

## Live stream 4
- Tutorial Q&A for [web scraping 101](docs/tutorials/webscraping101) and [APIs 101](docs/tutorials/apis101)
  - Re-watch [part 1 - introduction](https://youtu.be/GtkOC28O25I)
  - Re-watch [part 2 - web scraping 101](https://youtu.be/DpiLsc62f0E)
  - Re-watch [part 3 - APIs 101](https://youtu.be/e8sLCx1HXnY))

## Self-study
- Workflow for collecting online data (Tutorial)
  - [Technical Extraction Plan and Prototyping](docs/tutorials/workflow/extraction-plan-prototyping.md)
  - [Evaluate Legal and Ethical Concerns](docs/tutorials/workflow/legalfit.md)

  <!--- Design choices: modularity and storage *prerecorded*
  - Data capture and enrichment *prerecorded*
  - Deployment *prerecorded*
- Legal and ethical considerations when scraping <!-- *reading* [tba]-->

<!--
- Optional: Watch this screen cast in which I try to figure out how to [obtain data from an API that I haven't seen before](https://youtu.be/iDA710TPXT0)
  - The video may be particularly useful to students who wish to extract data from an API for their team projects.

<!--## Activities (individual exercises or team project)
- [Project] Make a data extraction plan for your website, taking into account legal and ethical concerns <!-- develop -->
