# Week 4: Data Availability Assessment, Research Fit, Legal Audit

## Self-study

- [APIs 101 (Tutorial)](docs/tutorials/apis101)
- Start fiddling around with accessing your chosen website or API.
- Conduct some background search/research on the current legal situation on using web scraping and APIs


## Activities
- Please prepare [Team Activity #3](../../../docs/course/project/workplan/activity3.md).
- If you've got some spare time left, try fiddling around with code to extract some data from your chosen website or API.

  <!--- Design choices: modularity and storage *prerecorded*
  - Data capture and enrichment *prerecorded*
  - Deployment *prerecorded*
- Legal and ethical considerations when scraping <!-- *reading* [tba]-->

<!--
- Optional: Watch this screen cast in which I try to figure out how to [obtain data from an API that I haven't seen before](https://youtu.be/iDA710TPXT0)
  - The video may be particularly useful to students who wish to extract data from an API for their team projects.
