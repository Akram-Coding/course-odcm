# Week 6: Data Packaging and Distribution

<!--- Feedback on coding up the data collection
-->
## Self-study
- Workflow for collecting online data (Tutorial)
  - [Preprocessing and Documentation](docs/tutorials/workflow/preprocessing.md)
  - [Using, Sharing, and Maintaining](docs/tutorials/workflow/use-and-maintain.md)
- Please read (including the web appendix) [Datasheets for Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf)
<!--- Tutorial: Data packaging and distribution-->

## Activities

- Please continue to work on the development of your prototype. Concurrently, try to start documenting your data collection - either in the Word template, or by using Jupyter Notebook (a combination of markdown cells for the text, and code cells for any analysis).

- You *can* submit - for live feedback - your __prototype script__ (e.g., Python script `.py`, Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb`). Note that it is not *mandatory* to upload material. Instead, the submissions should be seen as a way to receive feedback on your projects. Typical problems at this stage of your team projects are:
    - How to capture data, and convert it into a proper format for storage (e.g., CSV file, JSON file)?
    - How to verify whether all data that should have been downloaded/captured indeed was captured?
    - How to schedule/run the data colletion for extended periods?
    - How to deal with technical hurdles (e.g., authentication, logging in on a site, scrolling)

- Submission
  - Please upload your work in one zip file by Friday, 7.45am (Canvas).
  - Tips
      - Please structure your notebook so that it runs from top to down, up to the point where you encounter the error.
      - Please make use of Markdown cells to describe your problems concisely. Use headers (`# Header`, `## Subheader`), and formatting (`__bold__`, `*italic*`) where appropriate.
      - Indicate your team number in the file names, and __whether your submission is a scraper or API__ (e.g., `scraper_teamXX.ipynb`, `api_teamXX.ipynb`).
