<!--
4.5	Preprocess, validate, document, and distribute

Goal is distribution so that coauthors who were not involved in the process of scraping can readily use the data.

1.	Preprocessing
a.	Cleaning (e.g., take out HTML tags, take out observations for which IDs are NA, system errors, duplicates, …)
b.	Transformation (e.g., anonymization, pseudonymization)
c.	Data format (normalization, long-to-wide)
2.	Validation (“did I get what I wanted to get?”)
a.	Monitoring/logs (e.g., interruptions; report on those)
b.	Raw data (e.g., new variables may have shown up – include!)
c.	Preprocessed data (e.g., all variables GDPR compliant, encoding issues)
3.	Document
a.	For internal use
i.	Composition
ii.	Collection process
iii.	Preprocessing
iv.	Institutional background (e.g., screen shots, API documentation as a PDF, some blog articles about the site, …)
b.	For external use
i.	Motivation
ii.	Uses (and nonuses)
4.	Distribution
a.	Internal distribution
i.	FTP, S3
ii.	Own Dropbox, Drive
b.	External distribution
i.	Public repositories (e.g., dataverse, website)
ii.	When to distribute? Always; embargo
iii.	Licensing
