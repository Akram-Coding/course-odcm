<!--
a.	Software stack
i.	Packages (many ready-made packages in Python and R, directly from the service that has the API)
ii.	Self-programmed (if packages are not available for APIs, or generally for navigation in web scraping with full flexibility)
iii.	WYSIWYG tools (particularly in use for web scraping, but limited in functionality)
b.	Infrastructure
i.	Execution/running scrapers (one instance versus multiple instances, local versus remote)
c.	Monitoring
ii.	Status messages (e.g., time taken, units scraped, last time of data retrieval)
iii.	Detection of errors (e.g., time outs, empty data, changes in versions of API)
iv.	Notification on errors (e.g., manual lookup in log file, dashboard, phone push messages)
