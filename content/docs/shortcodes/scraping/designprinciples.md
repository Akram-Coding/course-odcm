# Design principles

## archival _vs._ live

- backward-looking (historical, archival) vs. forward-looking

Constant monitoring (if you don't do it now, you dont' have the data)

Examples

Errors to be minimized!

Backward: it doesn't matter hwen and how you get that information

- if forward looking: what are intervals (e.g., users/time retrieval limits)
- with specific research focus vs. investment in future
- type of content (text, vs. images, vs. videos)
- entities (e.g., users, products)
- type of variables (meta data, dependent variable, seeds)
- assessing space requirements
- dynamic nature (e.g., dynamic seeds, querying)
- monitoring
- deployment: locally (server restarts?, remotely?)
