## Learn how to mine the web

Welcome to the course website of oDCM.

This course teaches you the nuts and bolts about collecting web data using web scraping and APIs. Unlike most other courses on this topic, this course not only teaches you the *technicalities* of using web scraping and Application Protocol Interfaces (APIs), but also introduces a *comprehensive framework* that helps you to *think* about scraping - specifically with regard to its application in empirical marketing research.
