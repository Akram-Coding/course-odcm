## Learning objectives

-	Build an understanding of where to look for data, and assess the terms and conditions for using them
- Collect data via web scraping and Application Protocol Interfaces (APIs) by mixing, extending and repurposing code snippets
- Store and retrieve your collected data using structured and unstructured databases
- Transform semi-structured JSON data to structured data sets for statistical analysis ("parsing")
- Gain practical experience using Python, MySQL, MongoDB and Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Enable you to draft, execute, monitor and audit online data collections, that you can use to kickstart your own academic or commercial projects<!-- cronjobs-->
- Document and archive your data, and make them available for public (re)use
- Critically evaluate your own contribution and the contribution of team members

## Grading

- Individual take-home exercise(s) (20%)
- In-class contributions (e.g., session chair, presentations, pitches, discussions) (20%)
- Open science contributions (e.g., making course-relevant contributions to GitHub, or answering Q&As) (20%)
- Group project (4-5 team members) with peer assessment (40%)

Students pass this course if the final course grade (i.e., the weighted average of the components above) is at least 5.5/10.

## Format

- Taught fully online on Zoom, with the option for lab sessions on campus
- Hybrid format: Pre-recorded web clips for preparation and self-paced lab sessions; live streams for feedback and joint coding sessions (recordings will be made available)
- Modern content: copy-paste code snippets and demos from the course page, access code on GitHub, start projects with Jupyter Notebooks templates, sharing screens in class
- Interactive, immersive and student-centred: live coding, debates, open-source content contributions, scraping real websites and accessing real APIs
<!--, simulations, hackathon-->
<!-- work on VMs on AWS, code in SQL and R, compete on Kaggle, or work on own computer--; Coding Dojo student-=led analysis; while sharing screens-->

## Student profile / prerequisites

- The course is intended for both novices and those students with a technical background
- The student is instructed to MSc students, but also highly suitable for Research Master or PhD students who seek to advance their data collection skills
- Recommended courses at Tilburg to have taken before
    - Data Preparation using Python and R
- A high level of commitment, both in terms of time and effort, is expected

## Enrollment and Obtaining Course Credits

The course (3 ECTS) will be taught in the Marketing Analytics Program at Tilburg University. Please check Osiris for the specifics, or [contact the instructor](mailto:h.datta@tilburguniversity.edu).
