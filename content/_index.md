## Learning objectives

-	Identify online data sources and evaluate their value in the context of a specific research question or business problem
- Learn about and assess the terms and conditions for collecting, storing, and sharing data
- Collect data via web scraping and Application Protocol Interfaces (APIs) by mixing, extending and repurposing code snippets
- Transform semi-structured JSON data to structured data sets for statistical analysis ("parsing")
- Store and manage data using file-based systems and databases
- Gain practical experience using Python, MySQL, MongoDB and Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Enable you to draft, execute, monitor and audit online data collections, that you can use to kickstart your own academic or commercial projects<!-- cronjobs-->
- Document and archive your data, and make them available for public (re)use
- Track and share your own progress on the course's learning goals
- Critically evaluate your contribution and the contribution of team members to group projects ("peer assessment")

## Grading

- Group project (4-5 team members) with peer assessment (60%)
- Individual take-home exercise(s) (20%)
- Share progress and learnings (e.g., open science contributions in the form of course-relevant contributions in the form of pull requests to GitHub, maintaining a public FAQ/blog, sharing one's progress with the group) (20%)

<!--; can consist out of in-class contributions (e.g., presentation, pitch), code (e.g., data collection code), or reports -->

Students pass this course if the final course grade (i.e., the weighted average of the components above) is at least 5.5/10.


<!-- take home exercise: just submit; you get "DONE" on it as per the deadline -- make sure students stay up-to-date w/ the content

Elke toetsvorm (bijv. paper, exam, midterm) dient apart in Osiris te worden ingevoerd, met vermelding van minimum cijfer en wegingsfactor.

## Format

- Taught fully online on Zoom, with the option for lab sessions on campus
- Hybrid format: Interactive notebooks or pre-recorded web clips for preparation and self-paced lab sessions; live streams for feedback and joint coding sessions (recordings will be made available)
- Modern content: copy-paste code snippets and demos from the course page, access code on GitHub, start projects with Jupyter Notebook templates, sharing screens
- Interactive, immersive and student-centred: live coding, debates, open-source content contributions, scraping real websites and accessing real APIs

<!--, simulations, hackathon-->
<!-- work on VMs on AWS, code in SQL and R, compete on Kaggle, or work on own computer--; Coding Dojo student-=led analysis; while sharing screens-->

## Student profile / prerequisites

- The course is intended for both novices and those students with a technical background
  - We recommend novices to familiarize themselves with Python/Jupyter Notebook before the start of the course. Material (e.g., courses at Datacamp.com) will be shared with students well in advance.
  - Alternatively, novices may benefit from following other courses at Tilburg University in which Python is used, for example, *Research Skills: Data Processing* and *Research Skills: Data Processing Advanced*.
- The course is instructed to MSc students in the Marketing Analytics (TiSEM) program. Interested Research Master or PhD students who seek to advance their data collection skills can audit this course upon the approval of the course coordinator.
- A high level of commitment, both in terms of time and effort, is expected

## Enrollment and Obtaining Course Credits

The course (3 ECTS) will be taught in the Marketing Analytics Program at Tilburg University. Please check Osiris for the specifics, or [contact the instructor](mailto:h.datta@tilburguniversity.edu).
