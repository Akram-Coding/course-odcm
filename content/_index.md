# Online Data Collection and Management (oDCM)

**Use web scraping and APIs to mine the web**

<!--, and database management-->

_Tilburg University, Block 3, Course 328060-M-3, 2020/2021 (February - April 2021)_

_Instructor: [dr. Hannes Datta](https://hannesdatta.com)_

## Learn how to mine the web

Welcome to the course website of oDCM. This course teaches you the nuts and bolts about collecting data from the web. Unlike most other courses on this topic, this course not only teaches you the *technicalities* of using web scraping and Application Protocol Interfaces (APIs), but also introduces a *comprehensive framework* that helps you to *think* about scraping - specifically with regard to its application in academic marketing research.

## This website

This website is the backbone of the course, and features the following main sections.

- The __course__ section holds a list of weekly [modules](docs/course/modules), consisting of live streams, readings, and prerecorded clips. Even if you're not enrolled in this course, you can watch these clips, but interaction with the course instructor is reserved for enrolled students only.

- The [__tutorial__](docs/tutorials) section offers a workflow for collecting online data, and self-guided Jupyter Notebooks that teach the *basics* of data retrieval via web scraping and APIs. Use these to start your own scraping projects!

<!--- Finally, the [__building block__](docs/snippets) section offers a collection of code snippets in Python that you can use to build and extend your own scrapers and API retrieval projects.
-->
- Finally, the [__example__](docs/examples) section offers links to publicly available data collection projects, which you can use as an inspiration.
