# Course summary

## Course positioning

<img width="1000" alt="Course framework" src="odcm_positioning.png">

## Lessons learnt #1

__Opportunity Identification__

- Important of "broadening horizon" (e.g., scraper vs. API)
- Identify amazing contexts & have something to say!
  - Policy making: e.g., TikTok's search/suggestions
  - Socially relevant: e.g., BLM Tweets
- Data aggregators are ideal for multi-platform data
- Biggest platforms are not always best!

## Lessons learnt #2

__Data Availability Assessment__

- Look out for entities - especially the "surprising ones!"
- Look out for *variables* (e.g., to compare to other studies), but also to see time availability differences
- Real-time data collection required?! (e.g., wrong historical data, inaccurate timestamps?)
- Algorithmic biases present? Can exert control?

## Lessons learnt #3

__Evaluation of Research Fit and Resource Use__

- Choice of seeds may invalidate research design or inhibit generalizability
- Sampling is complex: consider projected running time, extraction frequency, sample size
- Anything to learn from the context (rather than the actual setting)? How to monitor it?

## Lessons learnt #4

__Technical Extraction Plan and Prototyping__

- Prototyping is extremely important
  - requests + beautifulSoup vs. Chromedriver
  - extraction methodology (e.g., tags, CSS)
- Writing helper functions, "moving code into production"
- Can you come up with more feasible navigation paths?

## Lessons learnt #5

__Evaluating legal and ethical concerns__

- Scientific purpose, and run by research institution?
- Scale and scope? (all data vs. small sample? running time)
- Location of data provider and users
- "Go" decision from provider? Technical intrusiveness?
- Data management & use, commercialization

## Lessons learnt #6

- Scheduling is handy
- Hiding passwords is even more handy
- Don't use a `makefile` for collecting (but only for preparation)
- Comment code, make it "understandable" for others


## Lessons learnt #7

- Start documentation from a `readme`
- Generate plots to spot errors in collection and "look" at the phenomenon of interest!
- Think as a "data supplier" rather than narrowly focusing on *one* question

# Looking ahead

## Recognizing Limitations

- Web data entails modeling challenges - not covered in this course (e.g., self-selection)
- Web data can't give you all (i.e., you don't see internal data) --> need for collaboration
- Legal and ethical issues not fully explored yet

## Potential Applications

- Collecting data for Master thesis
  - tell my colleagues you have the skills
  - start now, use later (data collection can take a long time!)

- PhD and research master students can "invest" into data collections
  - maybe *you are* a future PhD student? Start today! ;)
  - data was crucial to what I study

## Academic Opportunities from "what we study"

1. Scout out emerging phenomena (e.g., TikTok, Clubhouse, ...)
2. Study phenomena that can't be captured otherwise (i.e., unobtrusively)
3. Study diverse populations (e.g., moving being *WEIRD*, more socio-economic backgrounds + geographies)
4. Generating realistic stimuli for experiments (e.g., brand logos)

## Academic Opportunities from "how we study" it

1. Unleashing real-time data collections (cf. historical)
2. Conduct & support field experiments with a platform's user base
3. Use APIs to *access algorithms*, rather than data (e.g., Google Cloud Vision)
4. Build own [research APIs](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v094i09)

## Business Opportunities

::: notes

let's plan out 15 minutes


- invest into collecting data? vs. there's already a use case!
- only collect, or also "disclose"?
- way of deployment (e.g., reports, data, functions, algorithms)


IDEAS:
- show research API
- redesign of Osiris --> scrape data?
- find playlists on Spotify on scraping and APIs

# Next steps

## Official course evaluation

- Course evaluation has been critical to my career
  - Without my past (very good) evaluations, I wouldn't be teaching to you today
  - I will look at all comments
- Will post a link tomorrow
- Scores are most important to show importance of this course

::: notes

  - e.g., new (?) format (live streams rather than lectures)
  - e.g., new content (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks rather than books)
  - ...

:::

## Informal feedback

- live streams versus lectures?
- quality of internet website?
- open education good or bad?
- like the presence of external students (or not)?
- quality of Jupyter Notebooks
- "innovativeness of material", etc.
