# Data Availability Assessment

## Download the submissions now

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZnsH7eBKHuQLIH8nyRyoa_EjIQpo0RYb?usp=sharing


## Comments on your submissions (I)

> - Data Availability is about "all data", not research-specific data only (#1)
- Differences between entities and variables (#2, #5)
- Narrow versus broad RQ (investing in data, #3)
- Be specific about data source (website, API, #3), linkages (etc.), depth (#8)

## Comments on your submissions (II)

>- Tool for "choosing" the right data source, but, limited details (#4)
- What *is* data availability? (#7) - not an extraction plan
- Guidance in reading, full details? (#11)

## Break out activity

- Round 1: re-evaluate data availability, make list of comments/extensions (10 minutes)
- Round 2: teams meet up with one another, exchange feedback (5 minutes per team)
- Teams: 10 & 11, 9 & 1, 2 & 8, 3 & 4, 5 & 7, 6?


# Research fit and resource use

## Comments on research fit

## Calculating resource use


# Next steps

## Outlook

  - Today, 5pm

- Next week

## Any questions?

Stick around now if you have questions.

(e.g., installation issues, prep week)

::: notes

* can use the break for installation problems
* show on the website where they can find the information they need
* how to download the files (right click)
* manage expectations: DataCamp courses are simplistic (copy-paste etc.) and should not take too long, the data challenges are more challenging and will likely take more time, and are more representative of the level we expect in this course.

Thanks a lot, and have fun with the course!
