# Live stream #2

## Hi there!

Please turn on your camera :)

Fill in the getting-started-poll on Zoom!

## Agenda and Goals

- Checking in & updates
- A note on recordings
- Goals of part 1
  - Explore business and research ideas (w/ activities)
  - Give you some chance to meet each other
  - Initiate group formation

  - I worked through the tutorial "Web data for dummies" but don't have a clue what it was about and why I did it

Updates:
- Borrel on Zoom next week; Friday 16.45 onwards. We'll plan a few activities.
- Koffie momentjes planned; sign up on Canvas

# Part 1: Exploration of Business and Research Ideas

## Motivation to use scraping and APIs

1. Capture new phenomenas without formal data access
2. Better, cheaper, richer, more timely data on existing phenomenon
3. Construct/reconstruct new theories and improve external validity ("demand for field data")
4. Development and application of new methods

## Exemplary Research Cases (I)

- Increasing study relevance
  - Absence of formal data sources (e.g., historical prices on Amazon)
  - Timeliness and capturing important phenomena (e.g., scraping of social network to obtain music listening records)
  - Investment in data (e.g., Netflix & Everynoise data)

## Exemplary Research Cases (II)

- Increasing rigor
  - internal validity (real world behavior)
  - capture data at various moments (e.g., conduct longitudinal study, find "hidden" things)
  - increase sample size (& power; e.g., online field experiments)

::: notes

The key here is that students think about relevance and rigor.

- last.fm
- netflix homepage
- everynoise.com

## Exemplary (Future) Business Cases

- Getting data at cheaper rates, or with wider coverage than traditional gatekeepers (e.g., Inprijsverhoogd)
- Generate leads (e.g., LinkedIn)
- Automation (e.g., if-this-than-that, filling in forms)
- Powering and growing ecosystems (e.g., Philips Hue, Spotify's Web API)
- Using and selling proprietary algorithms and providing microservices
  - e.g., Amazon Web Services's ML libraries
  - e.g., Postcode API

SJOERD:

First of all, sorry for this late message.
At the moment im searching for/ thinking of cool & creative ideas in which we can apply web scraping.
I saw many videos on the internet and almost all of them are mentioning the same application (i.e. scraping reviews, price comparisons etc).

I really like some of the ideas and applications, especially scraping online reviews, but I am looking for something more innovative. In my opinion, the examples they mention in these video’s are not really ground breaking anymore since it already exists for many years and it is also applied by soo many businesses.

Conclusion of the story, do you know something about the “future of webscraping”? Basically where is this technology heading to and what industries will use this technology more often? If yes, could you maybe elaborate more in it during the class. I would love to hear more about, and gather some inspiration for developing new applications/ business models.

## Activity: Ideation

see week 1 --> [activity on the course website](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com/docs/course/modules/week1/activity)

::: notes

- comment on timeliness
- relevance for business / society
- incorporating different stakeholders

:::

## Break

Please put your Tutorial Q&A questions in the chat, or prepare yourselves to unmute yourself after the break and tell us what's been bugging you.

Please install TeamViewer, and - if requested - send your ID and password via WhatsApp to +31134668938.

# Part 2: Tutorial Q&A

## Open questions

Please ask your questions by unmuting yourself, or by using the chat!


<!--
- The result is a board with websites, and people that are interested in it

- Subscribe to at least 3 data sources.

- Together with other team members, fill in the "steckbrief" of these sites

<!--[split by academic research/ topic, vs. business): generating ideas for potential data sources / phenomena ("what's hot right now? What are important phenomena?", "what excites you about a potential area? what would be cool websites to monitor today?"

- Discuss: in which area does it fall? are people monitoring that site already? what capture would you hope to achieve? is this more "investment in data?"/"timeliness", or more robustness? is this more a covariate or a key thing?

- breakout groups: academia/business
- presentation to the entire group
- generate list of websites and APIs, and allocation to teams (4-5 students)

-->

## Next week

Topic: Assessing data availability and research fit

- Meetup to facilitate group formation: Tuesday, 9 February, 2021 (10:45 - 11:45)
- Form groups

Friday, 12 February, 2021 (08:45 - 10:30)

## Any questions?

Stick around now if you have questions.

(e.g., installation issues, prep week)

::: notes

* can use the break for installation problems
* show on the website where they can find the information they need
* how to download the files (right click)
* manage expectations: DataCamp courses are simplistic (copy-paste etc.) and should not take too long, the data challenges are more challenging and will likely take more time, and are more representative of the level we expect in this course.
