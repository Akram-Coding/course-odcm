## Agenda and Goals

- Web scraping 101
- Break
- APIs 101

::: notes

Today: relatively "free" session

Web scraping 101

APIs 101
- First, obtaining skills using a very simple API - Icanhazdajoke
- Then, use these skills on reddit.com


Way we do this: watch me "do it", search for code online, encounter problems, etc.

What I want to show:

- Stack overflow
- Problems of finding the right attributes


:::


# Next steps

## Outlook

- This Friday: prepare

- Next week
  - Learn how to conduct web scraping and retrieving data from APIs (two tutorials)
  - Catch up with remaining course content

- Next meeting
  - Tuesday, 23 February (--> Q&A on the two tutorials)

## Any questions?

Stick around now if you have questions.

(e.g., installation issues, prep week)

::: notes

* can use the break for installation problems
* show on the website where they can find the information they need
* how to download the files (right click)
* manage expectations: DataCamp courses are simplistic (copy-paste etc.) and should not take too long, the data challenges are more challenging and will likely take more time, and are more representative of the level we expect in this course.
